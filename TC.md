## Appendix C: Predictive Materials Engineering (The "Hardware" Proof)

**Added: December 2025**

The Simureality framework ($\Sigma K \to \min$) is not merely descriptive; it provides specific geometric criteria for the design of zero-resistance materials (superconductors) and high-coherence quantum memory.

### C.1 The Vacuum Resonance Constant ($\Gamma$)
Based on the optimization of electron transport through the discrete FCC grid, the fundamental "Vacuum Gate" parameter is derived as:
$$\Gamma = 2\pi a_0 \approx 3.325 \, \text{\AA}$$
Materials with a lattice parameter $a$ matching $\Gamma$ (or its harmonics $k \cdot \Gamma$) enter a state of "geometric resonance," minimizing computational impedance (resistance).

### C.2 Validation on Known Materials
1.  **Hydrogen Sulfide ($H_3S$):** Experimental $a \approx 2.98 \, \text{\AA}$ at 150 GPa.
    * Prediction: $0.9 \times \Gamma = 2.992 \, \text{\AA}$. (Error < 0.4%).
2.  **Mercury ($Hg$):** Experimental $a \approx 2.99 \, \text{\AA}$.
    * Prediction: $0.9 \times \Gamma = 2.992 \, \text{\AA}$. (Perfect match).
3.  **La-Ni-O System:** Pressurized to match System Tax Harmonic ($\Gamma \cdot 1.04^2 \approx 3.61 \, \text{\AA}$).

### C.3 Novel Prediction: The "Tuned Tantalum" Alloy
Current quantum computing relies on pure Tantalum ($a = 3.30 \, \text{\AA}$), which is geometrically close to $\Gamma$ ($3.325 \, \text{\AA}$) but has a -0.7% mismatch ("detuned").

**Hypothesis:** Expanding the Tantalum lattice by ~0.7% will result in a perfect vacuum resonance, leading to:
1.  Increase in Superconducting $T_c$ (from 4.4K to >10K).
2.  Exponential increase in coherence time for qubits (Zero-Dissipation Mode).

**Proposed Composition (The "Simureality Alloy"):**
* **Base:** Tantalum (Ta, BCC).
* **Dopant:** Zirconium (Zr) or Hafnium (Hf).
* **Target Metric:** $a_{mix} = 3.325 \, \text{\AA}$.
* **Calculated Stoichiometry:** $Ta_{0.91}Zr_{0.09}$ (approx. 9 atomic percent Zr).

This specific alloy composition is claimed as a direct prediction of the Simureality Geometric Framework prior to experimental verification.
