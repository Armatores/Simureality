## ENTRY 001: The Scaling Hypothesis

**Date:** December 2025
**Objective:** Detect the "System Tax" ($\gamma_{sys} \approx 1.0418$) in macroscopic matter.

**The Premise:**
We have successfully identified a universal geometric tax in nuclear physics (Proton Radius, Muon Mass). The core axiom of Simureality is scale invariance: *if a proton pays a tax for existing on the grid, a kilogram of iron must pay it too.*

**Initial Approach:**
We hypothesized that the Electronic Work Function ($\Phi$) — the energy required to eject an electron from a metal surface — is the macroscopic equivalent of Nuclear Binding Energy.
We postulated a naive geometric law:
$$\Phi_{pred} = I_{ion} \times P_{geo} \times \gamma_{sys}$$
Where:
* $I_{ion}$ = Ionization Energy (atomic property).
* $P_{geo}$ = Lattice Projection ($1/\sqrt{3}$ for BCC, $1/\phi$ for FCC).
* $\gamma_{sys}$ = 1.0418 (The System Tax).

**The Experiment (v1 - v4):**
We ran this simple formula against a dataset of standard metals.

**The Result: CHAOS.**
* **Tungsten (W):** Error < 0.5%. (Perfect match. We celebrated prematurely.)
* **Iron (Fe):** Error ~1%. (Excellent.)
* **Gold (Au):** Error **11.7%**. (Catastrophic failure. The predicted energy was much higher than reality.)
* **Calcium (Ca):** Error **31%**. (Complete divergence.)

**Initial Conclusion (Failed):**
The naive application of the System Tax works only for rigid, transition metals. For soft or noble metals, the tax seems to "disappear."
*Is the theory wrong? Or is the energy leaking somewhere?*
