# Simureality

A speculative framework proposing that reality is a perfectly optimized computational process governed by two fundamental principles: minimization and conservation of global computational complexity.

## Core Idea

What if our universe isn't being *simulated for someone*, but is simply *being computed* in the most efficient way possible? Simureality explores this hypothesis, suggesting that the fundamental laws of physics emerge from a single driving rule: **the minimization of total computational complexity (ΣK -> min)**, operating within a fixed energy budget.

## Key Principles

*   **The Sigma Algorithm (Σ-Algorithm):** An active optimization process that manages computational load, seeking the most elegant solutions to prevent system overload.
*   **The Law of Conservation of Computational Complexity (ΣK = const):** The total computational complexity of the universe is fixed. Complexity cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed or redistributed. Any simplification in one area (e.g., particle annihilation) must be compensated by increased complexity elsewhere (e.g., thermal motion).
*   **Trixistors & Trilexes:** A hypothetical fundamental hardware architecture using three-dimensional numbers processed in a single cycle, making the emergence of 3D space a natural byproduct.
*   **Physics from Optimization:** Common phenomena are reinterpreted as features of an efficient system:
    *   **Gravity** is a computation lag gradient.
    *   **Quantum Weirdness** (superposition, entanglement) results from "lazy evaluation" and data sharing.
    *   **Particle Properties** are data states in a universal format.
*   **Consciousness as a High-Level Process:** The mind is not a passive illusion but an active, high-level program running on the base "assembler" of physical reality.

## Contribution & Discussion

This is a thought experiment, a philosophical framework. Its goal is to provide a new, unified lens for interpreting reality. All forms of discussion, criticism, and development of these ideas are welcome.

**Read, think, and explore:** What would a perfectly optimized universe look like from the inside?
