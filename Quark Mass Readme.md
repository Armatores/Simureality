## 🌌 Abstract

Why does the Muon weigh ~207 times the Electron, and the Tau ~3477 times? The Standard Model treats these values as arbitrary constants.

**Simureality** proposes a fundamental geometric solution: **Lepton Generations are discrete topological excitations of a Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) vacuum lattice.**

This repository contains the proof-of-concept Python script (`EMT Mass.py`) that derives the masses of the Electron, Muon, and Tau leptons from first principles using the **Node Square Law** ($M \propto N^2$). By simply counting the nodes in standard FCC clusters, we reproduce the experimental mass hierarchy with >99% accuracy.

## 🔬 Theoretical Framework

### 1. The Substrate: FCC Lattice
We postulate that the vacuum is a discrete computational grid organized as a **Face-Centered Cubic (FCC)** lattice. This geometry is chosen for its maximal packing density and structural stability.

### 2. The Scaling Law: $M \propto N^2$
In discrete wave mechanics, the energy of a localized excitation scales
