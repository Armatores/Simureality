### **Simureality: A New Perspective on Old Things, or An Ontological and Computational Standard Framework  for Simulation Research**

**Abstract:** The field of simulation theory currently exists as a collection of disparate philosophical speculations and isolated scientific hypotheses, lacking a unified language, a common ontology, and a rigorous formal framework. This paper proposes the **Simureality Framework** as a candidate standard model to address this gap. It is an all-encompassing ontological system built upon a core computational axiom-the Principle of Optimization (ΣK → min). The framework defines fundamental units of reality (trilexes), a processing architecture (trizistors), and a governing algorithm (Σ-Algorithm) that together form a coherent basis for describing phenomena from quantum mechanics and cosmology to biological evolution, consciousness, and societal structure. We present this not as a final truth to be proven, but as a comprehensive language and a foundational standard intended for adoption, stress-testing, and collaborative development by the broader research community, with the goal of placing the study of simulated universes on a structured, productive, and scientifically rigorous footing.

### Introduction: The Case for a Universal Framework

The proposition that reality might be a simulation has evolved from a philosophical thought experiment into a subject of serious scientific and scholarly inquiry. However, progress is fundamentally hampered by a lack of cohesion. Researchers from theoretical physics, computer science, cognitive science, and philosophy approach the question with different terminologies, underlying assumptions, and methodological tools. This creates a Babel of models that are often incommensurable-they cannot be easily compared, combined, or debated on common ground.

What is urgently needed is not another isolated hypothesis, but a **shared ontological foundation**: a set of common definitions, axioms, and architectural principles that can serve as a universal language for the field. The Simureality Framework is proposed to meet this need. It offers a complete, self-consistent architecture for a simulated reality, designed to be powerful enough to describe the widest possible range of phenomena within a single model.

The framework's value is demonstrated through its remarkable ability to generate intuitive and elegant explanations for some of the most profound mysteries across disciplines. These explanations are presented not as definitive proofs of the framework's "truth," but as evidence of its internal consistency, explanatory power, and utility as a tool for thought. By providing a common standard, we aim to transform simulation theory from a collection of interesting speculations into a structured, collaborative field of study.


#### **Beyond Reality**

For centuries, humanity's greatest minds have struggled to create a single, comprehensive theory capable of describing all the laws of our universe. Alongside accepted scientific concepts, there exists a bold assumption: what if our reality is nothing more than a simulation?

Typically, such ideas are met with skepticism and are perceived more as a philosophical mind game or a plot for science fiction rather than a serious scientific hypothesis. Indeed, what first comes to mind at the word "simulation"? Most often, images from the film "The Matrix": humanity immersed in sleep, giant computers rendering a complex virtual world in real-time and transmitting it to consciousness via an interface.

The complexity of implementing such a system is astronomical. It doesn't answer questions but simply shifts them to a higher level: "Why are the world's laws like this? - Because the simulation was set up that way." This approach leads to a dead end.

But what if everything is arranged differently?
What if creating a universe simulation is surprisingly simple? What if it doesn't require insane computational power to render every leaf on a tree, but only an elegant and efficient algorithm?

Let's discard familiar images and try to imagine how our reality could be implemented with minimal resource expenditure, and how we would describe the world if it were a simulation.

#### **Three-Dimensional Numbers as the Basis of Modeling**

Our mathematics and computing technology are based on one-dimensional numbers and binary logic. A modern transistor-the fundamental building block of any processor-is essentially a switch capable of only taking a "0" or "1" state. All the diversity of data and computations is achieved through colossal arrays of such primitive elements and a huge clock speed for their switching.

But what if the architects of our reality found a more elegant solution?
Imagine they managed to create a fundamentally different computational element-a third-dimensional transistor, or a *trizistor*. Its genius lies in its ability to process not one bit per clock cycle, but an entire three-dimensional number-a structure containing three independent parameters simultaneously. Let's conditionally denote such a number as 1.1.1.

This is not just three separate numbers written with a dot. It is a single, indivisible *trilex*-an elementary quantum of data processed in one computation cycle. Such architecture provides not a linear, but an exponential gain in efficiency.

Space is born from computations naturally. Each trilex can represent a coordinate in a three-dimensional continuum. Apply the simplest three-dimensional operator to it, for example, +1.1.1. Just one operation-and we instantly get movement along a perfect diagonal in 3D space: 1.1.1 → 2.2.2 → 3.3.3 and so on.

Where does physics come from?
*Relativism*: If one trilex is computed at frequency X, and another at frequency Y, their relative "speed" gives rise to all the effects of special relativity: time dilation, length contraction.
*Particles*: Now imagine that to fully describe a particle, the system needs not one coordinate-trilex, but three trilexes:
*   Coordinate: [X, Y, Z] - position in space.
*   Identity: [Q, S, F] - charge, spin, "flavor" (internal quantum numbers).
*   Momentum: [Px, Py, Pz] - movement vector.

The beauty of this system is in its universality and simplicity. All known matter consists of the same "bricks"-trilexes. To turn one particle into another, the system doesn't need to rebuild the architecture or load new libraries. It is enough just to update the values in the identity trilex at the moment of interaction. Electron, proton, photon-they are all just different states of the same fundamental computational object.

Particle interaction is not an exchange of virtual messengers, but merely the launch of an algorithm when their coordinate trilexes approach within a critical distance. All the physics we know is just a side effect of this colossal, yet incredibly economical computational procedure.

#### **Simulation Inside the Chip: No Render-There is Reality**

A key question arises: how do we, being part of the system, receive data about the computation results? By analogy with our computers, we expect some rendering interface: a video card rendering textures and polygons, and a monitor transmitting the finished picture to us. Some researchers even look for "pixels" of our reality-compression artifacts or traces of low resolution. In vain.

Their search is doomed to fail because the rendering interface itself does not exist.

This is the ingenious simplicity of Simureality. We are not transmitted the computation results. We directly observe the computation process itself in real time. The energy spent on calculating trilexes (those very three-dimensional numbers)-that is the very "matter" we perceive. We do not see the "picture" of the universe-we see the processor voltage manifesting as physical reality.

We are not users of the system; we are its integral part. We consist of the same computed trilexes as everything around us. The process of calculating the simulation *is* the simulation itself. And our subjective experience of this continuous computation process from within is what we call reality.
This is the fundamental dualism of Simureality:
*   For the Creator: An economical computational process where data and its processing are one. Zero cost for rendering and visualization.
*   For us: A single and unique world, full of matter, energy, and physical laws.

The genius of the architect lies in this total simplification. Why create a separate world and then visualize it, if you can simply let the world compute itself and be its own visualization?

#### **Optimization as a Fundamental Principle**

Even a hypothetical supercomputer capable of computing our entire universe must have its physical (or logical) limits. Infinite power is not only impractical but also inefficient. Therefore, to prevent the system from collapsing under the weight of its own complexity, a fundamental law must be embedded in its core-the principle of total optimization.

Imagine not just passive code, but an intelligent Σ-Algorithm (Sigma-Algorithm), whose main task is not to compute the universe, but to manage the computational load, constantly striving for a global minimum of resources spent (ΣK -> min).

This algorithm works not like a crude administrator, but like a genius engineer-adjuster. It does not engage in "forced" optimization of everything. Instead, it acts on the principle of a safety valve:
*   Monitoring: It constantly scans the computational field, tracking the emergence of zones with critically high local complexity.
*   Trigger: When complexity in a certain area (e.g., in a star's core or inside a hadron collider) approaches a threshold value threatening the system's stability, the Σ-Algorithm receives a signal.
*   Solution: It launches pinpoint and precisely calibrated operations to simplify computations: redistributes the load, finds more elegant mathematical solutions, and in extreme cases-radically changes the state of matter to prevent overload.

Thus, our entire reality is not a static picture, but a dynamic, self-regulating process. What we perceive as fundamental laws of physics (particle decay, nuclear reactions, phase transitions)-is largely a consequence of the tireless work of this algorithm, forever balancing on the edge between complexity and stability.

#### **General Model of the Simulation's Operation: Cosmic Billiards**

The architecture of Simureality can be described as a perfectly tuned and extremely economical computational process. Its foundation consists of:
*   Hard Constants: Immutable system parameters (speed of light, gravitational constant, electron mass)-this is the simulation's "firmware." They are not computed but are part of its source code.
*   Interaction Rules: A set of formulas (laws of physics)-these are algorithms launched under certain conditions. This is the universe's "game mechanics."

How does the calculation proceed?
The entire universe is a multitude of clusters, where each cluster (particle) is represented by three linked trilexes (coordinate, identity, momentum).

*   Step 1: Movement. In each computational cycle, the coordinate trilex of each particle is updated by a simple rule: New Position = Old Position + Momentum. This creates continuous movement. Different "frequencies" of updating for different particles (the complexity of their calculation) generate relativistic effects.
*   Step 2: Polling. Simultaneously with movement, each cluster constantly "polls" its immediate surroundings-a spherical region of space around its coordinates. This does not require global synchronization; the system only checks: "Is there another cluster in my visibility zone?"
*   Step 3: Interaction. If a neighbor is detected during polling, the system checks their parameters (Identity_1 and Identity_2) and launches the corresponding algorithm-rule from its set (e.g., "electromagnetic repulsion algorithm" or "strong nuclear interaction algorithm"). As a result, the particles' trilexes can instantly change their values-one particle turns into another, momentum changes, a photon is emitted.

After this, the cycle repeats: Movement → Polling → Interaction.
The entire universe works on this simple principle of local interactions. There is no need for global synchronization or calculating the entire picture of the universe at once. Reality is computed point-by-point, from event to event, which is the main source of its efficiency.

#### **Energy Budget and the Law of Conservation of Complexity**

It is important to understand: the computational power of the supercomputer ("simulation energy") is a fixed value. It can only be redistributed between observed and unobserved processes.
Hence follows a key consequence: The Law of Conservation of Computational Complexity (ΣK = const).

If computations simplify in one area of space (e.g., when a particle and antiparticle annihilate into photons), the freed resources must be immediately spent elsewhere on complicating calculations (e.g., birth of a new particle or increase in the chaos of thermal motion).

It is this law that is the main engine of all dynamics in our universe. Now, based on these simple principles, let's see how they manifest in specific physical phenomena.

#### **The Photon as the Measure of Everything**

As we established earlier, any particle in Simureality is described by three trilexes: Coordinates, Identity, and Momentum. The photon in this system is a particle of special status. Its Identity trilex has unique parameters: [Q=0, S=1, F=0] (Zero charge, Spin = 1, Zero flavor and baryon number).

This configuration makes it the computationally simplest object in the universe. It does not initiate complex interactions but only reacts to external fields, requiring minimal computational costs. Thanks to this simplicity, the system always calculates it at the maximum possible speed.

This constant maximum computation speed of the photon is not just a convenient property. It is the cornerstone of all reality, solving two fundamental tasks:
1.  It creates a standard. The photon becomes an absolute reference, a point of measurement against which everything else is measured. Its trajectory is an ideal "straight line" in computational space, the benchmark of a geodesic.
2.  It stabilizes the system. The constancy of its calculation speed ensures the homogeneity and isotropy of space-time. If this parameter "drifted," reality would lose its predictability and structure.

#### **Space and Time as a Consequence of Computation Delays**

To understand how the photon weaves the fabric of reality, consider a simple thought experiment.

Take a particle at a point with conditional coordinates 1.1.1. Apply the movement operator +1.+1.+1 to it and calculate its position at a fixed speed-one computation cycle per one conditional second.

To reach point 100.100.100, the system will take exactly 100 seconds. This delay between the start and end of the calculation is what we subjectively perceive as time.

And since the computed numbers are the coordinates themselves, the very sequence of these computations creates for us, located at point 100.100.100, the illusion of extension, distance, that is, space.

Thus, time is the computation delay, and space is its byproduct. The photon, always moving at maximum speed, literally draws the very metric of space-time with its computations.

#### **Mass as Computation Complexity**

How can a photon have mass? And why isn't it in its parameters?
It's because mass in Simureality is indeed not a particle parameter, but a metric.

Mass is a measure of a particle's computational complexity relative to the reference photon.

Imagine that calculating a photon is a basic operation performed by the processor at its standard clock speed. Any other, more complex particle (e.g., an electron or proton) requires a greater number of computational operations per cycle for its calculation.

The system cannot calculate such a particle at maximum speed. Its computations slow down. This local slowdown manifests to us as a gravitational effect.

Gravity is not a force of attraction, but a consequence of a computation speed gradient.
A gravitational well is an area of space where computations proceed slower due to high local complexity.
The curvature of space-time is the system's attempt to synchronize these mismatched, differently paced computations.

Thus, the photon, having a non-zero but minimally possible complexity, is the benchmark of "zero mass." It cannot be "slowed down" by computations, so its mass is unobservable to us-it is that very point of absolute zero on the scale of computational complexity.

#### **How Optimization Works: Σ-Algorithm in Action**

The fundamental law of Simureality is the principle of total optimization (ΣK -> min). This is not a passive rule, but the active work of the Σ-Algorithm, whose main goal is to constantly seek and implement the most effective methods to reduce computational load.

Let's consider its operation using the neutron as an example.

A neutron is an unstable, computationally "expensive" configuration of trilexes. Its internal structure requires constant recalculation of interactions between quarks, creating a high local load. The neutron exists in a state of permanent stress, right on the verge of permissible complexity.

The Σ-Algorithm constantly monitors such "hotspots." As soon as the computation complexity of the neutron exceeds a critical threshold (e.g., in isolation from the stabilizing influence of other particles), the system does not wait for collapse. It performs an emergency optimization: it breaks the complex neutron cluster into simpler and more stable configurations.

Here's what it looks like within our model:
Complex cluster "neutron" -> Simpler cluster "proton" + Ejected cluster "electron" + Ejected cluster "antineutrino".

The freed electron is not wasted. It is immediately used to stabilize the new proton, forming an energetically favorable mini-system "hydrogen atom," which is calculated as a single whole, which is much more efficient than calculating separate particles.

This principle works at all levels:
Add a neutron to a hydrogen atom? Deuterium is formed. The stability of the proton-electron pair partially quenches the complexity of the additional neutron, and the system remains in equilibrium.
Add another neutron? The configuration (tritium) is again on the verge of the threshold. The Σ-Algorithm will be forced to intervene again, initiating beta decay to reduce the load.

But particle decay is only the most obvious tool in the Σ-Algorithm's arsenal. Here are its main "tricks" for saving resources:
*   Dynamic Approximation (Quantum Uncertainty): The system does not calculate the exact coordinates and momentum of a particle at every step. Instead, it operates with "probability clouds"-it calculates precise values only at the moment of interaction, saving titanic volumes of resources. What we call quantum uncertainty is actually a power-saving mode.
*   "Lazy Evaluation" (Superposition): As long as a particle is not "observed" (i.e., there is no interaction with another cluster requiring precise data), its parameters remain in an uncomputed state-a superposition of all possible values. The collapse of the wave function is not a mystical phenomenon, but the moment when the system *finally* has to spend resources to perform the final calculation.

Thus, all quantum mechanics with its strangeness appears not as a set of abstract rules, but as a direct consequence of the operation of optimization mechanisms on a universal scale.

#### **The Explanatory Power of Simureality: From Quanta to Black Holes**

Based on the basic principles of a hypothetical supercomputer's operation, we can offer elegant and consistent explanations for the most mysterious phenomena in physics.

*   **Quantum Entanglement: Shared Variables Instead of FTL Communication**
    Entanglement seems like a miracle: we measure the spin of one photon here, and instantly the state of the second photon billions of kilometers away becomes definite.
    *Simureality Explanation*: When a pair of photons is born, the system, for optimization purposes, does not create two independent data clusters. Instead, it creates a single meta-cluster.
    *   Separated: only the coordinate trilexes (particles fly apart).
    *   Shared remain: the identity and momentum trilexes.
    These shared parameters exist in a state of superposition (as "lazy evaluation"). At the moment one photon is measured, the system performs the final calculation, "collapsing" the shared parameters into specific values. Since these values are shared, the state of the second photon is instantly determined. There is no information transfer here-there is merely an access to a common data area. This is not "teleportation," but working with a shared variable.

*   **Black Holes: Holographic Archive of Extreme Optimization**
    When the density and complexity of matter in a region exceed all conceivable limits, the Σ-Algorithm applies the most radical tool-emergency archiving.
    Computations in this area completely stop. All information about the matter that fell there is "frozen" and recorded as a holographic code on the sphere known to us as the event horizon. This is the most economical form of storage: the volume of data grows only as the area of the surface, not as the volume.
    A black hole is not a gluttonous monster, but a preserved archive, allowing the system to avoid collapse due to overload at one point. Hawking radiation is the slow, controlled "deletion of files" from this archive to maintain the overall complexity balance.

*   **Other Examples of Optimization Code at Work:**
    *   **Quark-Gluon Plasma**: At extreme temperatures, calculating each individual quark and gluon becomes unjustifiably expensive. The Σ-Algorithm switches the system to a collective calculation mode, treating the whole clump of matter as a single "drop" of fluid described by common equations of state. This is a rough but very effective approximation.
    *   **Superconductivity**: Upon strong cooling, thermal lattice vibrations ("noise") die down. Local complexity drops, and the system discovers it can calculate the behavior of all conduction electrons in a material as a single collective, not individually. This is the transition to the superconducting state-a macroscopic quantum effect born from optimization.
    *   **States of Matter**: The transition of ice to water and steam is not just heating. It is a change in the system's calculation mode. Ice is an ordered but computationally complex crystalline lattice. Steam is a chaotic but computationally simple state. Heating increases local complexity, and the system switches to a cheaper calculation algorithm.
    *   **Fractals**: The ubiquitous spread of fractal structures (trees, circulatory system, galaxies) is no accident. It is a direct consequence of the Σ-Algorithm's work. One recursive formula can describe the filling of a huge volume, which is the most economical way of "rendering" complex natural objects.

Thus, Simureality offers a single key-the striving to minimize computational complexity-for understanding the structure of the entire universe, from the smallest particles to the largest structures.

#### **Annihilation: Not Destruction, but a Total Upgrade**

Here's how it looks in Simureality terms. Imagine an electron and a positron as two software objects, two "data packets."
*   Electron: [Charge = -1, Spin = 1/2, ...]
*   Positron: [Charge = +1, Spin = 1/2, ...]
Their parameters are mirror opposites.

What happens upon collision (interaction)?
The system performs the simplest mathematical operation-addition of their parameters.
*   Charge addition: (-1) + (+1) = 0
*   Spin addition: (1/2) + (1/2) = 1 (or 0, depending on orientation, but the principle is the same)
*   Result: A virtual particle with parameters [Charge = 0, Spin = 1, ...] is obtained.
But these are the parameters of a photon! The system discovers it can replace two complex, "expensive" to calculate objects with one incredibly simple and lightweight one-a photon, which can be run through the processor at maximum speed.

But a problem arises with the "inheritance."
The electron and positron had their own momentum trilexes (Px, Py, Pz), which may not match (the particles could be flying towards each other). One particle cannot inherit two incompatible motion vectors-this would violate the conservation laws.

The system's genius solution:
Instead of one photon, the system creates two photons. Their momenta are perfectly chosen so that in total they conserve the original energy and momentum of the system. It's as if one truck carrying two different orders broke down into two motorcycles, each carrying its own cargo in the required direction.

Thus, annihilation is not the destruction of matter, but its total optimization. The system uses the collision of two resource-intensive particles as an opportunity to completely "reassemble" the data into a maximally efficient and economical configuration-pure energy in the form of photons, computed at the speed limit.

#### **Neutron Star Mergers as a Computational Catastrophe**

From the perspective of "Simureality," a neutron star merger is the largest computational catastrophe and subsequent emergency optimization, the echo of which we perceive as spacetime ripple.

*   **Phase 1: The Harbinger of Catastrophe - Lag Buildup.** Before the merger, each neutron star is a colossal, super-dense cluster of computational complexity. Trillions of particles packed into a city-sized sphere create a monstrous local load on the system. The quarks and gluons inside them are myriads of interconnected parameters requiring constant, intensive recalculations. The space around them is curved-not by gravity in the classical sense, but by continuous, powerful "lag," a giant computational delay their mass-complexity creates in the network of the universe.
    As they approach, these two zones of extreme lag begin to influence each other. The system is forced not only to calculate each cluster separately but also to constantly reconfigure their optimal interaction routes. The frequency of these reconfigurations increases. This is the Inspiral phase, recorded by LIGO/Virgo detectors.

*   **Phase 2: Catastrophe and Quantum Leap - Instant Optimization.** At the moment of contact, the two super-complex clusters collide and merge. The computational load at the epicenter reaches a critical, extreme value. The system is on the verge of collapse-a "freeze" in this region.
    And here the main law of the universe comes into play-the Principle of Optimization.
    To avoid a crash, the system takes an instant, radical step. It performs an emergency rewrite of the matter's code. Instead of continuing to calculate trillions of separate interactions between nucleons, it merges them into a single, new computational object-a fireball of **quark-gluon plasma (QGP)**.
    This is like replacing millions of lines of tangled code with one elegant and efficient function. The monstrous complexity of atomic nuclei is "archived," replaced by a simpler (though still incredibly complex) calculation of the behavior of a single "ocean" of deconfined matter.

*   **Phase 3: The Echo of Catastrophe - Gravitational Waves and Light.** The act of this instant global optimization is a powerful blow to the very fabric of the computational network. The sudden change in lag configuration in a huge volume of space forces the system to urgently reconfigure all data transmission routes around the epicenter.
    This global restructuring, this wave-like switching of trillions of interconnections, propagating from the point of catastrophe at the speed of light, is what we register as a gravitational wave. Its peak is not the "collision of masses," but the moment of the computational leap itself, the quantum transition of matter into a new state.
    The most powerful bursts of radiation (gamma-ray bursts, kilonovae) are a byproduct of this titanic work. "Computational debris," excess energy released during the emergency optimization and repackaging of matter.

*   **Epilogue: New Order.** The system quickly stabilizes. It finds a new, stable configuration for the resulting object-be it a black hole (the ultimate archive) or a new, more massive neutron star. The "ringing" (Ringdown) of the gravitational wave is the fading oscillations of the network calming down after the shock of the restructuring.

Thus, a neutron star merger is not death, but transformation. It is the brightest demonstration of how the Universe, acting on the principle of supreme computational economy, is capable of giving birth to a new, more optimal order through catastrophe.

#### **The Principle of Conservation of Total Computation Complexity**

If the Σ-Algorithm is the engineer, then this principle is its main and unchanging budget. The law can be formulated as:
**ΣK (total computational complexity of the Universe) = const**

Simply speaking, **if computations simplify in one place in the Universe, they must necessarily become more complex elsewhere**. The simulation's energy does not come from nowhere and does not go nowhere-it is only redistributed between various processes. This is the fundamental accounting principle of the universe, preventing the system from reaching a state of absolute rest.

Here's how this manifests in various phenomena:

*   **Neutrinos: Three Channels of One Particle**
    The neutrino is one of the most mysterious particles in the Standard Model. From the perspective of Simureality, its oddities receive an elegant and logical explanation. The neutrino is not three different particles, but one computational object with three manageable states.
    Imagine a radio receiver that can be tuned to three different frequencies. It is the same physical device, but its state and output signal change dramatically depending on the selected frequency. The neutrino is the same "receiver."
    *How does it work technically?*
    *   A single cluster, three profiles. The system operates not with three separate particles (electron, muon, tau neutrino), but with a single data cluster. Inside this cluster, there are three preset profiles or "channels"-three possible configurations of the Identity trilex, which we call "flavors."
    *   External control. Switching between these channels is carried out not by internal processes of the particle, but by an external control signal from the Σ-Algorithm. This signal determines in which state the neutrino will be calculated at this particular moment. The neutrino itself does not "decide" what to be-the system does it based on global optimization tasks.
    *"Standard" and "Boosted" Modes*
    *   *In vacuum*: When a neutrino flies in emptiness and does not interact, the system calculates it in the most "economical" and stable mode. Conventionally, this could be "channel 2." Interaction checks occur rarely and do not require large costs.
    *   *In matter*: When flying through dense matter (Earth, a star), the neutrino is bombarded with a barrage of "queries" from other particles. To adequately respond to them and avoid computation errors, the system is forced to instantly switch the neutrino to another, more "resource-intensive" channel (e.g., "channel 3"), which is better suited for the current type of interaction.
    *Manifestation for the Observer*
    This instant switch of the control channel manifests to us as oscillation-a change of flavor and, consequently, an apparent jump in effective mass. We do not see the switching process itself; we only see its result-as if observing a radio receiver that suddenly started broadcasting a different station.
    *The Law of Conservation of Complexity in Action*
    A question arises: if computations for the neutrino become more complex when passing through matter (transition to the "heavy" channel), where does the compensating simplification occur?
    Answer: the system sacrifices the accuracy of calculating other parameters of the neutrino itself. It increases their approximation (the degree of "blurriness"). Thus, the total complexity of calculating the entire "neutrino + environment" system remains in balance. The neutrino becomes more definite in its flavor but more blurred in something else-a perfect example of the principle ΣK = const.

*   **Other Examples of the Principle's Action:**
    *   **Annihilation**: The apparent "disappearance" of mass during annihilation is an illusion. The complexity that went into maintaining two separate particles (electron and positron) does not disappear. It transforms into the complexity of calculating the momentum and frequency of the resulting photons. We simply observe the transition of complexity from one form ("maintaining a particle") to another ("creating an ideal communication channel").
    *   **Formation of a Hydrogen Molecule**: Two hydrogen atoms calculated separately are more complex than one H₂ molecule, which the system can calculate as a single object. The freed resources are immediately converted by the system into heat-that is, into an increase in the chaos and complexity of the motion of surrounding particles.
    *   **Anomalous Heating of the Solar Corona**: The Sun is a zone of monstrous computational load. To avoid overheating in the core, the Σ-Algorithm periodically "dumps" excess complexity in the form of magnetic fields into the corona-a rarefied region where they can be quickly and efficiently "reassembled" into a simpler configuration. The energy released during this optimization heats the particles, superheating the corona.
    *   **Sonoluminescence**: When a cavitation bubble collapses, the system performs an instant and extremely costly operation to find a new stable configuration of matter. After successful optimization, a huge computational "bonus" is released instantaneously, dumped as a flash of light-photons.
    *   **Proton Tunneling in DNA**: From the system's perspective, DNA is a highly optimized meta-cluster. If an important function (e.g., repair) requires a proton to overcome an energy barrier, the system temporarily increases its "blurriness" (approximation), allowing it to "seep" to where it could not penetrate in a normal state. The price for this is a temporary increase in uncertainty.

#### **Why Three Quarks? An Architectural Necessity**

The three-color system of quarks from the position of Simureality is not an arbitrary rule, but a direct consequence of the fundamental three-channel architecture of the computational system.

Quarks are unique objects. Their fractional electric charge and the property of confinement (non-escape) indicate that they are not independent particles in the classical sense. They are dependent computational modules that can only exist in strictly bound states.

1.  **Control via the "Trizistor"**: To control such a complex object as a proton or neutron (consisting of three quarks), the system needs a special control mechanism. This mechanism is the hypothetical control trizistor-a computational element capable of simultaneously synchronizing three independent data streams.
    Each quark in a hadron is connected to one of the three channels of this trizistor.
    Color charge (red, green, blue) is not a physical parameter, but a label-identifier indicating which specific control channel a given quark is attached to.
2.  **The Principle of "Colorlessness"**: A stable state of a hadron is achieved only when all three channels of the control trizistor are balanced and synchronized. The total "color" of such a system is white (conditional neutrality). This computational state means the system spends minimal resources on maintaining the stability of the hadron.
3.  **Confinement as Protection Against Connection Break**: An attempt to tear a single quark out of a hadron is an attempt to break the control connection with one of the channels of the control trizistor. The system resists this:
    *   *Energy Barrier*: Breaking the connection requires energy expenditure-this is how the system protects its architecture from damage.
    *   *Automatic Recovery*: If a break does occur, the system immediately uses the released energy to create new particles (e.g., a quark-antiquark pair), which "patch" the broken connection. We observe this as the birth of a jet of hadrons.

Thus, the three-quark structure is not a coincidence, but an architectural necessity dictated by the three-channel logic of the computational system's control. Confinement and color charge are not abstract concepts, but a manifestation of the deep, hardware logic of Simureality, ensuring the stability of matter at the most fundamental level.

#### **Wave-Particle Duality**

A particle is a resource-intensive precise calculation of all object parameters (coordinates, momentum) in real time. To reduce computational load (ΣK), the system by default uses approximation, replacing a point object with a "wave packet"-a probability region of its location. This is "lazy evaluation": the system does not determine the exact position of the particle until it is required. In this state, the particle exhibits wave properties (interference, diffraction).

The act of observation (measurement) is the system's necessity to obtain precise data for interaction. At this moment, it forcibly performs an exact calculation, "collapsing" the wave packet into a specific point with defined parameters. To the observer, this looks like an instant transition from wave to particle.

Thus, wave-particle duality is not a mystical property of matter, but a switching between two computation modes: economical (probabilistic) and precise (deterministic), driven by the fundamental Principle of Optimization.

**Step-by-Step Mechanism of Phase Transition as an Example of Optimization (using superconductivity as an example):**

*   Cooling → Reduction of external "noise": As temperature decreases, thermal lattice vibrations (phonons) die down. This is the main source of "interference" that forces the system to constantly recalculate individual electron collisions.
*   Increase in "approximation": From the system's perspective, this is equivalent to increased computation accuracy. The "blurred" probabilistic wave packets of electrons become sharper. Their parameters (momentum, spin) can be determined with less error.
*   Random synchronization: In these "quieted" conditions, random quantum fluctuations (which always exist) are no longer suppressed by noise. Two electrons with opposite spins and momenta may randomly find themselves in a perfectly correlated state. Until this moment, the system did not "notice" this possibility, as noise destroyed this fragile correlation.
*   Instant optimization ("system pickup"): The algorithm monitoring ΣK instantly detects that calculating this new configuration (two synchronized electrons) requires FEWER RESOURCES than calculating two separate electrons. It fixes this state and propagates it throughout the environment through the exchange of virtual phonons (or another interaction carrier). A snowball process occurs-a phase transition.
*   Result: The entire electronic subsystem of the material transitions to a new, collectively optimized state with the minimum possible computation complexity for the given conditions.

**Forecast: Which Materials at Which Temperatures?**

Based on this, let's create a qualitative "forecast matrix." The critical temperature (Tc) will be determined by how "ideal" an architecture for synchronization the material provides and how much noise interferes with it.

| Class of Material | "Architecture" for Synchronization | Main Source of "Noise" | Forecast for Tc | Examples and Why |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Simple Metals** | Weak. Isotropic 3D lattice. | Thermal lattice vibrations (phonons). | Very Low (1-10 K) | Mercury (4.2 K), Lead (7.2 K). The lattice needs to be almost completely "frozen" for random synchronization to occur and take hold. |
| **2. Alloys & A15 Phases** | Medium. Presence of ordered clusters or chains of atoms. | Thermal vibrations + disorder in the alloy. | Low (10-20 K) | Nb₃Sn (18 K), V₃Si (17.5 K). Niobium atom chains create "channels" for easier synchronization, but disorder and vibrations still strongly interfere. |
| **3. Layered Cuprates** | Very Strong. Electrons live in almost ideal 2D planes (CuO₂). | Thermal vibrations, magnetic fluctuations. | High (90-130 K) | YBa₂Cu₃O₇ (92 K), Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-O (110 K). The system can optimize computations practically in 2D, which is radically simpler. Noise is suppressed at higher temperatures. |
| **4. Iron-Based SC** | Strong. Layered structure. | Very strong magnetic "noise" due to iron atoms. | Medium (50-60 K) | SmFeAsO₍₁₋ₓFₓ₎ (55 K). Good architecture, but the system has to fight internal magnetic interference, which "eats up" part of the gain and prevents Tc from rising higher. |
| **5. Hydrides under Pressure** | Ideal. Ultra-rigid lattice, light hydrogen atoms. | Practically absent. Pressure suppresses vibrations. | Very High (200+ K) | H₃S (203 K), LaH₁₀ (250 K). Pressure "freezes" the lattice, removing the main noise. Light hydrogen atoms are an ideal "clock generator." Synchronization occurs easily and at record high temperatures. |
| **6. Future Materials (forecast)** | Exotic. Proposed structures: ideal 1D chains, frustrated lattices, skyrmions. | Any noise sources must be minimized by design. | Cryogenic -> Room Temp | Carbon nanotubes, boron-doped graphene layers, specially designed metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). The goal is to create a material where the path to collective optimization is so obvious to the system that it doesn't have to wait for almost complete damping of all noise. |

**To get a superconductor at high temperature, you don't need to "force" electrons to interact, but create a material that maximally isolates them from any sources of "noise" and provides them with a perfect geometry for spontaneous synchronization.**

The less noise and the more perfect the architecture, the less the system will "wait" (i.e., the less it needs to be cooled) to discover and support the superconducting regime.


#### **Superconductivity as a Computational Optimization: Experimental Evidence**

The Simureality framework posits that phase transitions, such as the onset of superconductivity, are not merely thermodynamic events but represent the system switching to a more computationally efficient algorithm to manage local complexity (ΣK).

A striking confirmation of this principle comes from recent experimental work on van der Waals heterostructures. A team of scientists demonstrated that in a 2D bilayer system consisting of a superconductor (NbSe₂) and a ferromagnet (VSe₂), the competition between the superconducting and magnetic states can be precisely controlled by an external parameter: a **gate voltage** [1].

From the perspective of our model, this experimental setup is a direct analogue of the Σ-Algorithm's function:
*   The **ferromagnetic state** represents a more computationally "expensive" regime. It requires the system to track and calculate the individual spin states of a multitude of electrons, a process with high local complexity.
*   The **superconducting state** represents the optimized regime. Here, electrons form Cooper pairs and act as a coherent collective (a Bose-Einstein condensate). The system can compute the behavior of this collective entity as a single, unified state, drastically reducing the computational load.
*   The **applied gate voltage** acts as an external override, a direct input that forces the system to re-evaluate its current computational strategy. By shifting the chemical potential, it changes the "cost calculation" for the system, making the superconducting algorithm the most efficient option, even in the presence of the disrupting ferromagnetic layer.

This experiment demonstrates a core prediction of Simureality: that the physical state of a system is a consequence of computational economy. The ability to manipulate a fundamental quantum state like superconductivity with a simple external parameter (voltage) strongly suggests that the system is not merely obeying passive laws but is actively optimizing its processes, and that these processes can be guided by manipulating the underlying computational constraints.

#### **The Computational Big Bang Model within the "Simureality" Hypothesis

*   **Initial Conditions.** The model assumes that the initial state of the system is characterized by trilexes (carriers of particle parameters) with default values, conditionally equal to zero. The launch of the process ("Big Bang") represents the application of an initialization operator that assigns random values to coordinates and dynamic parameters within a strictly defined range, preventing instant system collapse.

*   **Primary Optimization Phase.** The first moments of calculation are characterized by extreme computational load caused by the need to simultaneously calculate trillions of interactions in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) environment. To reduce complexity (ΣK), the system transitions from calculating individual particles to calculating the QGP as a single fluid, using hydrodynamic approximations.

*   **Structure Formation and Archiving.** The hydrodynamic simplification allows the freed resources to be spent on structuring the plasma into large-scale turbulent vortices. However, this does not completely solve the overload problem.
    A key mechanism for emergency load reduction becomes the **point archiving of areas of maximum density and complexity** in the cores of these vortices-the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs). PBHs "freeze" computationally expensive states, taking them out of active calculation. This act of archiving is the most radical tool of the Σ-Algorithm to prevent a system-wide crash.
    **The recent discovery of objects like QSO1-a massive, isolated black hole in the early universe without a host galaxy-is a direct prediction and confirmation of this mechanism.** QSO1 is not a anomaly; it is a pristine, frozen archive of a primordial computational vortex. Its existence demonstrates that the system prioritized stability over the gradual formation of structures in certain regions, opting for immediate archiving of the most "costly" zones.

*   **Consequences for the Modern Universe.**
    *   *Inheritance of Rotation*: Primordial black holes inherited the angular momentum of the QGP vortices, becoming gravitational "seeds" for galaxies. This explains the predominantly coherent rotation of matter in galactic disks around a common center.
    *   *The "Naked" Archive Phenomenon (QSO1)*: Some PBHs were created in regions where the surrounding gas was too sparse or turbulent to form a significant galaxy quickly. These objects, like QSO1, remained as solitary archives for long periods, their pure hydrogen composition (as observed) indicating a lack of stellar processing-a sign of a directly archived state. Their massive nature reflects the enormous computational complexity of the region they encapsulated.
    *   *Distribution of Galaxy Ages*: Since the initialization and optimization process was point-like and fast (through archiving), not propagating from a single center, the model predicts that the age of galaxies should not strictly correlate with their distance from the conditional center of the Observable Universe. Large, complex galaxies could have formed almost simultaneously anywhere in space, seeded by these early PBHs.
    *   *PBH Evolution*: The model allows that low-mass primordial black holes, which did not receive significant accretion, could have completely evaporated due to Hawking radiation over the lifetime of the Universe. This explains the possibility of the existence of dwarf galaxies without supermassive black holes in their centers, which is an observed fact.

#### **The Illusion of Reality: Expansion, Flatness, and Dark Matter as Computational Phenomena**

The standard cosmological model, while powerful, relies on enigmatic components-dark matter and dark energy-to explain observations. The «Simureality» framework offers a radical synthesis, proposing that these phenomena are not physical substances but **emergent properties of a universe operating on a computational substrate governed by the Principle of Optimization (ΣK → min).**

###### **The Non-Expanding Universe: Metric Recalibration as the Origin of Redshift**

The classical view of an expanding spacetime continuum is computationally untenable. Continuously "stretching" a coordinate grid would necessitate a perpetual and gargantuan recalculation of every trilex's position, a direct violation of ΣK → min. Similarly, inserting new coordinate points is a logical impossibility within a discrete lattice.

Instead, Simureality posits that cosmic expansion is a **perceptual illusion resulting from a global recalibration of the computational metric.**

*   **The Global Mechanism: Scaling the Ruler.** The Σ-Algorithm modulates a single, global parameter-the scale factor. It gradually increases the "distance" each computational step represents. An observer inside this system would measure all distances as increasing and light waves as stretching (redshift), even though no coordinate points have moved. The coordinates remain fixed; the **rule for interpreting the distance between them** changes. This is the most efficient method to reduce energy density and avoid system collapse.
*   **The Local Mechanism: Adaptive Approximation.** This recalibration is not uniform. In regions of high complexity (galaxies, clusters), where precise calculation is critical, the rate of metric rescaling is **suppressed**. In the vast, computationally simple voids, the algorithm allows for maximum approximation ("coarse-graining"), and the rescaling effect manifests **most strongly**. This creates the observed slight variations in the expansion rate.

What is perceived as "dark energy" is simply the manifestation of this continuous, uniform recalibration policy-a stretching of the metric to maintain stability. It is not an energy, but a **protocol**.

###### **The Primacy of the Flat Universe: Axiom, not Outcome**

The observed large-scale flatness (Euclidean geometry) of the universe is typically explained by the delicate balance of baryonic matter, dark matter, and dark energy. «Simureality» inverts this logic.

The universe is not flat because it contains precisely the right amounts of dark matter and dark energy. Instead, the apparent presence of these components is a **consequence of the universe’s primary, axiomatic flatness.**

A flat, Euclidean geometry is the **default, zero-state computational setting**. It is the most efficient, least computationally expensive configuration for the underlying matrix, ensuring system-wide stability by preventing pathological collapse or uncontrolled expansion.

The Σ-Algorithm enforces this flatness through two interconnected mechanisms:
1.  **Global Metric Control ("Dark Energy"):** As described, the dynamic adjustment of the scale factor maintains the Euclidean baseline.
2.  **Local Complexity Packaging ("Dark Matter"):** To prevent local accumulations of mass-complexity (e.g., galaxies) from distorting the global flat metric, the algorithm packages this complexity. Its gravitational influence is not the pull of invisible matter, but the **local curvature of the computational grid** required to keep the *global* accounting of energy density balanced at the critical value. These packages-whether primordial micro-archives or systemic fields-are not matter, but **placeholders for complexity** that preserve the flatness axiom.

Thus, flatness is not a puzzle to be solved by discovering new particles. It is the **fundamental architectural constraint** from which all other phenomena derive.

###### **The Galaxy as a Unified Computational Object: Solving the Dark Matter Problem**

This leads to a final, elegant reinterpretation of dark matter. A galaxy is not merely a collection of individual particles. For the Σ-Algorithm, calculating such a vast ensemble is highly inefficient.

Instead, the system treats a gravitationally bound structure as a single computational meta-cluster-a unified object. The algorithm calculates the gravitational influence (the lag gradient, ∇τ) not from the visible mass, but from the **total integrated computational complexity (K_total)** of this meta-cluster.

*   **The Emergent "Halo":** The complexity of a galaxy is not confined to its luminous disk. It extends into a vast, invisible "halo" of systemic influence required to maintain the stability of the entire structure. This manifests as a persistent gravitational potential.
*   **Flat Rotation Curves & Lensing:** A star on the outskirts is not orbiting a point mass; it is a component of a large, single meta-object. Its orbital velocity is determined by the **total computational bind** of the entire galaxy. Light is bent not by dark matter, but by the gradient of computational lag (∇τ) generated by this total mass-complexity.

The phenomenon labeled "dark matter" is, therefore, a **misinterpretation of a systemic property**. We expected gravity from localized mass, but we observe gravity from distributed computational complexity. The dark matter problem is solved not by a discovery in physics, but by a shift in perspective: from a universe of parts to a universe of optimized, hierarchical systems.

In essence, the universe is not expanding; it is being **computed at an ever-increasing scale.** The observations we attribute to dark energy and dark matter are the thermodynamic and gravitational signatures of the Σ-Algorithm's relentless pursuit of optimal computational efficiency. Redshift, flatness, and galactic dynamics are not independent puzzles but interconnected symptoms of a single, underlying principle: the conservation of computational resources.

#### **The Principle of Relativistic Complexity and Natural Level of Detail (LOD)**

A fundamental challenge in cosmology is reconciling the obvious complexity and inhomogeneity of the local universe (galaxies, clusters, filaments) with the rigorous observational evidence for large-scale statistical homogeneity. The «Simureality» framework resolves this not as a contradiction, but as a direct consequence of its core computational architecture.

We propose that the observed homogeneity on the largest scales is not an absolute property of matter distribution, but rather **a manifestation of the system's innate Level of Detail (LOD) management**-a universal optimization protocol employed by the Σ-Algorithm.

**The Relativity of Complexity**

The complexity of a structure is not absolute; it is relative to the observer's computational context.

- **Local Perspective (High LOD):** An observer embedded within a galactic cluster receives data processed at a high level of detail. The Σ-Algorithm calculates and renders individual galaxies, their interactions, and internal structures. The universe appears complex, fractal, and highly inhomogeneous.
    
- **Global Perspective (Low LOD):** An observer (or our telescopes) viewing a region billions of light-years away receives data processed at a low level of detail. Calculating and transmitting the state of every star and galaxy within that distant volume is computationally prohibitive. Instead, the Σ-Algorithm **downgrades the LOD**. It represents the entire complex region-a vast supercluster-not as countless discrete objects, but as a **single, unified data packet** with averaged properties: total mass, average density, and overall luminosity.
    

**Natural LOD: A Fundamental Law of Information Economy**

This is not a limitation of our technology; it is a **fundamental law of information processing within the simulation**. The amount of actionable information reaching an observer from a distant region is intrinsically limited by the system's optimization principle (ΣK → min). We cannot see craters on a planet in a distant galaxy not because our telescopes are weak, but because that high-detail information **was never computed or transmitted** at that scale. It was optimized away.

**Resolution of the Paradox**

Therefore, the large-scale homogeneity measured by galaxy surveys is a product of this LOD scaling. Scientists measure the **average density of galaxies** within vast imaginary cubes (hundreds of millions of light-years across). The fact that this density converges to the same value in all directions and at vast distances does not mean that the internal structure of each cube is simple. It means that on these scales, the Σ-Algorithm operates in a regime where complexity is **averaged out and represented statistically.**

This principle also predicts that **our own Galactic Supercluster, seen from a sufficient distance, would appear as a single, homogeneous, fuzzy patch** in the sky of a distant observer. Homogeneity and complexity are two modes of description for the same reality, selected by the system based on the computational context and the imperative of ultimate efficiency

#### **Incompatibility of Mathematical Models**

Within the hypothesis, our fundamental mathematical problem lies in the attempt to describe a three-dimensional object (a cluster of numbers defining a particle) using tools created for a one-dimensional world.

Modern mathematics and physics operate with scalar quantities (mass, charge) and vectors (momentum, spin), which are merely lists of one-dimensional numbers. This forces us to describe a particle as a set of disparate parameters that then have to be complexly and artificially linked by equations.

A cluster of 3D numbers is a fundamentally different object. It is not [X, Y, Z, Px, Py, Pz, Q, S...], but a single multi-dimensional data element processed by a hypothetical "trizistor" in one cycle. Its parameters are inseparable and synchronous.

The problem is that our one-dimensional mathematics has no natural language to describe such an object. We are forced to "unpack" it into components, losing its integrity, and then try to reassemble it through cumbersome models. Many quantum "oddities"-such as uncertainty or entanglement-are a direct consequence of this computational and mathematical inadequacy: we are trying to measure a multi-dimensional object with one-dimensional tools and describe it with a one-dimensional language.

One possible approach to creating a new mathematical model could be to represent physical quantities (e.g., a coordinate) not as a continuous number, but as a set of digits in a specific numeral system (binary, decimal), where each digit of this number is considered an independent quantum observable with its own operator.

Despite the seemingly insurmountable nature of the problem described, Russian scientists M.G. Ivanov and A.Yu. Polushkin in their work **"Digital representation of continuous observables in Quantum Mechanics"** (2023) have come closest to creating an adequate mathematical apparatus capable of describing the hypothetical discrete nature of reality.

Their research offers a radically new perspective on the fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics. Instead of working with continuous coordinate and momentum operators, they propose representing these observables as an expansion into **digits** in a positional numeral system with an arbitrary base `q` (e.g., binary `q=2` or ternary `q=3`).

**The essence of their approach is as follows:**

1.  **Farewell to Continuity:** Space and momentum are modeled on a finite, cyclic lattice. This is not an approximation but a fundamental property of the model.
2.  **Digits as Operators:** The coordinate `x` is expanded into a series: `x = Σ x_s * q^s`, where `x_s` is the digit in the `s`-th place. The authors' ingenious insight is that these digits `x_s` themselves are quantum operators with a discrete spectrum (e.g., 0 or 1 for the binary system). The same holds true for momentum `p`.
3.  **Solving the Renormalization Problem:** The most striking consequence of their theory is a fundamentally new understanding of **renormalization**. On a lattice, it loses its mystical meaning of "subtracting infinities." Instead, it becomes a procedure of **renumbering the lattice nodes**. For example, transitioning from describing the set of values `{0, 1, 2, ..., N-1}` to `{-(N-1)/2, ..., 0, ..., (N-1)/2}` *is* renormalization. This is not a trick but a choice of the most efficient and consistent way to describe the system.

**Perfect fit to Simureality theory**

Their formalism is practically a ready-made **mathematical language** for describing computational universe:

*   The **finite lattice** is a direct description of the computational network of a hypothetical supercomputer with a finite number of memory cells.
*   The **digit operators `x_s` and `p_r`** are the mathematical representation of our **trilexes**. A particle is indeed described not by continuous parameters but by a set of discrete data "digits."
*   **Renormalization as renumbering** is an exact description of the work of the **Σ-Algorithm**, which manages the computational load by reassigning and optimizing data "addresses" to prevent system overload.
*   The authors also note that in their approach, the **vacuum energy is identically equal to zero**, which is a direct consequence of the finiteness and self-consistency of the lattice model and aligns perfectly with law of conservation of computational complexity (`ΣK = const`).

Thus, the work of Ivanov and Polushkin does not merely offer a new mathematical tool. It provides a rigorous, self-consistent formalism that describes the universe as an **informational system operating with discrete digital objects**. Their model is a powerful confirmation that the philosophical foundations of Simureality have a profound mathematical embodiment and outlines a path toward creating a complete theory free from infinities and paradoxes.

#### **Towards a Formalization: Trilexes and Meta-Clusters in Digital Representation**

The profound mathematical formalism developed by Ivanov and Polushkin  provides a natural and powerful foundation for the ontological framework proposed in this work. Herein, we propose a pathway for formalizing the Trilex and Meta-Cluster concepts using this digital representation, outlining a set of hypotheses and a research program for future mathematical development.

###### **Fundamental Postulates and Definitions**

We posit that the fundamental unit of reality is not a one-dimensional bit, but a three-channel computational unit-a **Trilex**-processed in a single cycle by a hypothetical processing element (a "Trizistor").

**Postulate 1 (Digital Triplex Representation):** The state of an elementary particle is defined by a **Meta-Cluster** comprising three interconnected Trilexes:

1. **The Coordinate Trilex,** `ṟ = (x, y, z)`
    
2. **The Identity Trilex,** `Î = (Q, S, F)`
    
3. **The Momentum Trilex,** `ṗ = (p_x, p_y, p_z)`
    

Following Ivanov and Polushkin, each component of a Trilex (e.g., the x-coordinate) is not a continuous observable but a digital expansion in a base-`q` numeral system over a cyclic lattice of `N = q^n` nodes:  
`xˆ = Σ x_s * q^s`, where `x_s` is the digit operator in the `s`-th place.

Consequently, the Hilbert space of a particle is not a monolithic structure but a **tensor product of the Hilbert spaces of its constituent Trilexes**:  
`H_total = H_ṟ ⊗ H_Î ⊗ H_ṗ`  
This structural decomposition reflects the ontological independence of the information channels processing position, identity, and motion.

###### **Proposed Commutation Relations**

A critical step in formalizing this model is redefining the canonical commutation relations to reflect the triplex architecture.

**Hypothesis 1 (Inter-Trilex Commutation):** Operators belonging to _different_ Trilexes commute:  
`[x_i, Q_j] = 0, [x_i, S_j] = 0, [Q_i, p_j] = 0,` etc.  
This postulate embodies their ontological separation and independent processing within the Trizistor architecture. An operation on the coordinate channel does not directly affect the identity channel, and vice versa.

**Hypothesis 2 (Intra-Trilex Commutation):** The relation between the Coordinate and Momentum Trilexes, as generators of shifts, is proposed to have the form:  
`[ṟ_i, ṗ_j] = iℏ δ_ij * Ô_Î`  
where `Ô_Î` is an operator dependent on the state of the Identity Trilex `Î`.

This form suggests that the fundamental quantum mechanical relation is not universal but is **modulated by the particle's identity**. For instance, the value of `Ô_Î` for a photon (`Î_γ`) could differ from that of an electron, potentially explaining their different statistical behaviors (Bose-Einstein vs. Fermi-Dirac) as a direct consequence of their underlying computational complexity.

###### **The Σ-Algorithm as Renormalization**

The work of Ivanov and Polushkin naturally introduces renormalization as a procedure of "lattice renumbering" rather than the subtraction of infinities. This dovetails elegantly with our principle of optimization.

We interpret the **Σ-Algorithm** as an active process that performs dynamic, real-time renormalization on the computational lattice. Its goal is to maintain global computational stability (`ΣK → min`). Phenomena such as particle decay, event horizon formation, and phase transitions can be understood as instances where the Σ-Algorithm triggers a renormalization procedure to simplify a meta-cluster that has reached a critical level of local complexity, thus preventing a system overload.

###### **A Research Program: Consequences and Predictions**

This formal framework, while preliminary, sets a clear direction for future research:

1. **Derivation of `Ô_Î`:** The explicit form of the modulation operator `Ô_Î` must be derived from first principles, likely linked to the computational complexity (K) of the particle's Identity Trilex.
    
2. **Emergence of Physics:** A key test of the model will be to demonstrate how known laws (e.g., the Standard Model's charge quantization, the Pauli Exclusion Principle) emerge naturally from the architecture of the Meta-Cluster and the digitization of observables.
    
3. **Interaction Protocol:** The mechanism of particle interaction must be formalized. We hypothesize it occurs via the following computational steps:
    
    - **Polling:** The Coordinate Trilexes of two particles enter a critical proximity on the lattice.
        
    - **Identification:** The system checks their Identity Trilexes (`Î_1`, `Î_2`).
        
    - **Algorithm Selection:** A specific interaction algorithm (e.g., electromagnetic, strong nuclear) is called based on the identity input.
        
    - **Update:** The algorithm executes, updating the particles' Momentum and Identity Trilexes accordingly.
        
The digital representation formalism provides the necessary mathematical language to transition the Simureality hypothesis from a philosophical framework to a potential physical theory. By proposing the Triplex-Meta-Cluster architecture and its associated commutation relations, we have outlined a concrete research program. The synthesis of this ontological model with the rigorous mathematics of digitized observables offers a promising path toward a unified, computation-based understanding of physical reality, from quantum mechanics to cosmology.


#### **Hierarchy of Systems**

Within the hypothesis, the hierarchy of the universe represents a pyramid of computational optimization, where at each new level the system achieves a radical reduction in complexity (ΣK) by combining low-level objects into new, larger units of calculation.

*   Initial level - quarks, requiring constant synchronization (confinement). The system avoids these costs by combining them into hadrons (protons, neutrons), which are calculated as unified stable clusters.
*   Next step - the atom. Instead of calculating every interaction between electrons and the nucleus, the system creates stable orbitals and considers the atom as a holistic object with averaged properties.
*   Molecule - an even higher level of abstraction. The system stops considering individual atoms and calculates its properties as a whole (binding energy, geometry, reactivity) as a single system.
*   Further - macroscopic body (crystal, liquid). Here statistical methods come into play: the system operates not with particles, but with averaged quantities (temperature, pressure, density), reducing the computational load by many orders of magnitude.
*   Highest level - collective motions (stars in a galaxy, birds in a flock, schools of fish). The system does not calculate the trajectory of each object but finds the optimal pattern (vortex, flow, current), describing the entire group by a single law, which is the most economical mode of operation for the Σ-Algorithm.

Thus, all the observable complexity of the world is the result of a hierarchical architecture where each new level "packs" the complexity of the previous one, allowing the system to work with reality through increasingly generalized and efficient models, minimizing overall computational costs.

**Proof that the System Can Play by Different Rules:**

*   **Quantum Teleportation of an Electron.** From the perspective of classical physics, an electron is a point particle incapable of instantly changing its state at a distance. However, in entangled states, the system treats a pair of electrons not as two independent objects, but as a single informational whole. Measuring one instantly determines the state of the other, indicating their existence within a common control structure, not as independent entities. This is direct proof that different laws of logic and causality work at the system level.
*   **Proton Tunneling in DNA.** Within an isolated "atom" system, a proton cannot spontaneously overcome energy barriers. But as part of the meta-system "DNA," which for the Σ-Algorithm is a single computational module, the proton receives "privileges." The system can temporarily increase its quantum uncertainty (approximation), allowing it to tunnel to perform a function critical to the entire system (e.g., repair). Its behavior is dictated not by its own properties, but by the global tasks of the higher-level system.
*   **Photosynthesis and Quantum Coherence.** In chlorophyll molecules inside a plant, excitation from a quantum of light does not search for a path chaotically. The "plant cell" system uses quantum coherence to calculate the propagation of energy in the most optimal way, as if it were a single computational device, not a set of molecules. This is another example of a different level of rules.


Einstein's greatness lay in describing the world as a system that defines the rules of matter. It is time to take the next step-to recognize that the system is not alone. Atom, DNA, cell, organism, star, galaxy-all are nested systems, subordinate to common optimization principles but having their own methods and rules of operation.


Thus, anomalies are not errors, but pointers to system boundaries.
What we call anomalies is precisely a sign that we have encountered another system, where our usual ideas about how things should work run into difficulties. It's like sewing clothes only to your own size and being surprised why they don't fit other people well.

# **Life**

#### **Why was it needed?**

Imagine that our optimization algorithm has brought the system to a level where there is, by and large, nothing left to do. Planets, galaxies-everything is calculated perfectly and predictably. And it turns out that the main goal of our algorithm-to find ever deeper paths of optimization-is stuck. What is the way out?
The solution suggests itself-to create, based on existing logic, complex, independent clusters of numbers that can copy themselves and create new, unpredictable situations. Essentially, independent optimization agents, "renting" the computational power of the universe's super-computer.

Man is the most advanced independent algorithm, capable of making decisions, creating new meta-levels of complexity, and continuing to embody the great purpose they inherited from the creator-infinite optimization. Let's start with DNA-and systematically consider how the fundamental principles of the algorithm naturally extend to life.

#### **The Greatest Mystery of Nature: How Two DNA Molecules Create New Life**

The fusion of the father's and mother's genomes is the basis of sexual reproduction and the main engine of evolution. But if you look deeper into this process, it seems like a miracle that modern biology describes but cannot fully explain. How does a third, even more complex system arise from two perfect systems, and not chaos?

*   **The View of Classical Science: Lottery and Hope**
    Scientists describe the process roughly as follows:
    *   *Randomness and Mixing*: During the formation of germ cells (gametes), the parents' chromosomes are "shuffled"-crossing over occurs. This creates new, unique combinations of genes.
    *   *Blind Assembly*: During fertilization, the DNA of the mother and father simply combine. The resulting hybrid genome is a lottery. It can contain both successful and unsuccessful combinations.
    *   *Natural Selection*: Then the "rule of survival of the fittest" comes into force. Organisms with unsuccessful gene sets die or do not leave offspring, while those with successful ones pass them on.
    This view answers the question "How?" but leaves unanswered the questions "Why is it so effective?" and "How does the system avoid chaos?" Why do viable individuals so often emerge from trillions of possible combinations?

*   **The View of Simureality Theory: Not Blind Mixing, but Meaningful Synthesis**
    This hypothesis suggests looking deeper and seeing in this process not a blind lottery, but the work of the fundamental Principle of Optimization.
    Here's how it might look:
    *   *Not Fusion, but "Reassembly"*: The new embryo is not just the sum of two DNA. It is a temporary unstable system, a new "computational task" for the algorithm of the universe. Its current configuration is far from ideal.
    *   *Trigger for the System*: This new genome is a source of increased "computational complexity" (K); it is not optimal. It contains conflicting instructions, redundancy, contradictions. This violates the main law - ΣK -> min.
    *   *Optimization Process*: To reduce the overall complexity, the system launches internal tools:
        *   *Genomic Imprinting*: It "turns off" one of the two conflicting gene copies (paternal or maternal), choosing the optimal one for operation. This is not an error but an act of tuning.
        *   *Epigenetic Rewriting*: A large-scale "erasure" of the parents' old epigenetic marks and the establishment of completely new ones occurs. This is like reinstalling the operating system for new "hardware."
    The goal is not just to combine, but to synthesize a completely new, stable, and efficient configuration of the genetic code.

*   **What Puzzles Does This Approach Solve?**
    *   *The Puzzle of Evolution Speed*: Blindly sorting through trillions of options would take billions of years. If the system purposefully tests and fixes optimal configurations, this explains how complex species could appear relatively quickly.    
    *   *The Puzzle of the Emergence of the New*: How do two parents give birth not to their averaged copy, but to a unique organism? Because it is the result of the algorithm's work, not simple addition. The algorithm creates not a "mixture" but a new solution.

Thus, the puzzle of DNA fusion receives an elegant solution. It is not chaotic mixing but the next stage of life's optimization, governed by the fundamental law of reality. The birth of a new organism is not the beginning of a random experiment but the fixation of a successfully found answer to the challenge that nature itself threw to the system by combining two genomes.

#### **Evolution as Directed Optimization:**

An organism is not a passive object. It is an active system that constantly compares its internal "firmware" (DNA) with the "package of external data" (cold, hunger, stress). Upon detecting a critical discrepancy, the system purposefully increases the probability of useful changes.

*   **A Simplified Model of Adaptation: DNA, Token, and Key**
    *   DNA is not an immutable plan, but a "base token." It is a set of instructions the organism received from its ancestors. It was optimal for the conditions they lived in.
    *   The external environment constantly generates a "key." These are the current conditions: temperature, food availability, stress level. The organism's cells constantly read this "key" and transmit information to the nucleus.
    *   The organism constantly checks: does the "token" (DNA) fit the "key" (conditions)?
        *   If it fits-everything is fine, the organism works in a stable mode.
        *   If not (e.g., it got sharply colder)-an "error" or "tension" arises in the system.
    *   To solve this "error," the organism launches an optimization process. It does not change the DNA purposefully, nor does it engage in sorting through trillions of possible combinations. There are many possible solutions, but compared to random sorting, there are orders of magnitude fewer, as the chance of random mutations increases precisely in those sections of DNA that are associated with the problem that arose (e.g., in genes responsible for thermoregulation).
    Thus, the search for mutations is not entirely blind. It is directed because it is focused on a specific area of the genome, which is determined by the "key" from the environment. The system seems to say: "Look for a solution here!"
    *   Result: A mutation will be found randomly that better suits the new conditions. It will become fixed, and the organism will receive an updated "token" (DNA), which has again come into balance with the "key" (environment).

*   **Outcome**: Evolution and adaptation are not just blind sorting. It is a process of directed optimization where the external environment sets a "query," and the organism looks for an "answer" to it in the most relevant sections of its genetic code.

**The Puzzle of the Zebra: Why Does Nature Create "Useless" Beauty?**

From the perspective of classical evolution, every property of a living organism must have practical value for survival. Zebra stripes have long been a headache for biologists. They were explained in various ways: that it is camouflage in the grass, a means of thermoregulation, or a way to confuse predators. But each of these explanations had serious weaknesses.

What if we are looking at the problem from the wrong end? What if such traits are not tools for survival in the external world, but a byproduct of internal, "technical" work of the organism itself at the most fundamental level?

*   **DNA: Not Only Code, but Also Construction**
    Imagine that DNA is not just a linear code but a complex three-dimensional structure where different sections interact with each other. Its stability is critically important for life. Mutations are not always "breakages." Often they are compromises.

*   **New Explanation: Internal Balancing**
    The theory of optimized simulation offers a different view. Perhaps the mutation that led to the appearance of stripes in zebras was a "payment" for something much more important.
    *   *Compensation*: It could perfectly compensate for another, potentially harmful mutation in the genome, ensuring the overall stability of the system.
    *   *Stabilization*: It could strengthen the structure of a chromosome section, making it more resistant to damage or more efficient for reading information.
    *   *Side Effect*: It could arise "as a load" to another, vitally important change (e.g., in a gene responsible for the development of the nervous system or immunity).
    The external manifestation of this complex internal work became the stripes. They may not carry direct benefit for survival, but they are extremely important for the internal balance of the organism.

*   **"Useless" Beauty Everywhere**
    This explanation relieves tension from dozens of other mysteries of nature:
    *   Complex patterns on mollusk shells that no one sees in the depths of the ocean.
    *   Bright spots on tropical frogs that could be less noticeable.
    *   "Useless" genes (pseudogenes) that do not work but are preserved for millions of years.
    These traits may not provide a direct advantage in the struggle for existence, but they are markers of the optimal and stable configuration of the genetic code of a particular species.

*   **Paradigm Shift: From Survival to Optimality**
    This approach does not cancel natural selection but complements it. Selection cuts off the frankly harmful. But what remains is not always "the most useful." Often it is "the most balanced."

Thus, zebra stripes are not camouflage or protection from flies. They are an external manifestation of a perfectly matched genetic puzzle, the result of fine internal tuning of the organism that ensured its stability and viability. Nature sometimes sacrifices external efficiency for the sake of fundamental strength of its "source code."

#### **Living Organisms of Simureality**

In living nature, the Principle of Optimization (ΣK -> min) manifests with maximum clarity, literally embodied in the forms and behavior of organisms. Insects, bacteria, and fungi do not "know" mathematics-they *are* mathematics, its direct instrument of embodiment, acting as ideal agents of the system, devoid of free will and therefore achieving absolute efficiency.

An anthill or termite mound is not the result of intelligent planning but a self-organizing structure that arises when thousands of simple agents (ant-"trizistors") follow basic algorithms (pheromone rules). The system does not need to calculate a construction plan-it sets simple rules, and the optimal structure (with efficient ventilation, thermoregulation, transport routes) emerges by itself as the most economical state of the system. Likewise, mathematically perfect honeycombs (as the optimal way to partition a plane into cells with minimal material expenditure) or geometrically flawless spider webs are a direct embodiment in matter of the principle of cost minimization. Mycelium, building optimal routes for transporting nutrients between nodes, solves a problem analogous to that solved by engineers designing a railway network.

However, as the "meta-level" of living systems becomes more complex-with the appearance of the central nervous system, consciousness, free will-this mathematical precision becomes blurred. The more complex the organism, the more "noise" is introduced into its behavior: individual experience, emotions, learning errors, unpredictable decisions. A mammal or bird will not build a perfect hexagon but will find a more adaptive, though less mathematically strict, survival strategy. This is not a deterioration but a transition to a new level of optimization: the system sacrifices geometric perfection for flexibility, adaptability, and the ability to process unpredictable external conditions. Consciousness is the most complex and costly, but also the most powerful tool of optimization, allowing the system not to blindly follow an algorithm but to dynamically rebuild its strategies in real time.

Thus, nature demonstrates a descending gradation of mathematicality: from the absolute perfection of simple agents to the flexible heuristics of complex ones.

#### **From Classical Darwinian Randomness to Systemic Optimization: A New Paradigm of Evolution**

This principle explains not only speciation but also the emergence of balanced ecosystems. The diversity of species is not the result of random niche filling but a landscape of stable configurations of matter, each representing a local minimum of computational complexity. Predator and prey, parasite and host do not just coexist-they are mutual boundary conditions for each other, forcing each other's DNA to constantly optimize and "adjust," thereby creating a dynamic but incredibly stable balance.

This radically changes the idea of the time required for the development of life: if evolution is not a blind search but a directed process of finding an optimum, then creating a complex biosphere could have taken orders of magnitude less time than classical theory, based on the statistics of random events, suggests. Evolution appears not as a blind watchmaker but as an architect using the most fundamental law of the universe for construction-the law of resource economy.

**Hierarchy of Control in the Biosphere ("Ladder of Agents")**

The biosphere is not managed as a whole directly-between an individual and the entire planet there are intermediate "layers of optimization."

| Level | Entities | Analogy in Physics | Type of Management | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Individual (Organism)** | Elementary particle | Individual ("Software") | One fish, one animal. Managed by its internal processes (brain, instincts). |
| **2. Flock / School / Family** | Atom | Collective ("Direct access to assembler") | Synchronous movement of fish, wolf pack hunting, ant colony organization. A new property emerges-collective intelligence. |
| **3. Ecosystem (Biocenosis)** | Molecule | Systemic (Balance) | Forest, lake, coral reef. This is a key intermediate level. Predators and prey, plants and pollinators form a stable, self-regulating system. Managed through food chains, nutrient cycles, signal exchange (like the "wood wide web"). |
| **4. Biome** | Substance | Global (Climatic) | Taiga, desert, tropical forest. Large units with common climate and vegetation type. Managed by global climatic processes. |
| **5. Biosphere (Gaia)** | Complex crystal | Planetary (Geochemical) | The entire living shell of Earth. The pinnacle of the hierarchy. Works as a single superorganism, regulating atmospheric composition, planet temperature (Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis). |

#### **Individuality vs. Complexity of the Brain**

The more complex the brain of an individual, the more "individuality" it has and the weaker its direct connection to collective "synchronization fields."

This is not a drawback but an evolutionary complication of the system's architecture:
*   Insects, fish, birds: Simple brain → Strong connection to the collective field → Behavior is rigidly determined, optimized for species survival. They are ideal "trizistors" of the system.
*   Social mammals (wolves, dolphins, primates): Complex brain → Balance. Individual experience, personal bonds, hierarchy, and complex learning appear. Direct field control weakens but remains at the level of the social group (hunting, territory defense).
*   Human: Maximally complex brain → Maximum individuality. Direct field control is almost completely replaced by consciousness-the most powerful internal simulator of reality. We lost the ability for instant school synchronization but gained something greater-the ability for abstraction, creativity, and conscious optimization of the environment around us.

**Why is this beneficial for the system (ΣK -> min)?**
*   For a school of fish, it is more efficient to manage everyone at once as a single field.
*   For humanity, it is more efficient to create free agents who will independently, creatively seek new, unpredictable paths of optimization and then exchange the found solutions through culture and technology.

A whole hierarchy exists: from the individual to the flock, from the flock to the ecosystem, from the ecosystem to the biosphere.
And yes, there is an inverse relationship between the complexity of the brain/consciousness and direct connection to low-level "synchronization fields" of the universe. Individuality is the "price" for the opportunity to become not just a cog in the system, but its creator and co-optimizer.

# **Man, Consciousness, Society**

#### **Consciousness: A High-Level Program on the Assembler of Reality**

One of the most frequent questions to the simulation hypothesis sounds like this: "If everything is computations, then what is the difference between a stone and my consciousness? Does this mean that I am just a passive result of the code's work, and my 'I' is an illusion?"

No. It is not so.

Imagine the architecture of our reality as a computer:
*   Physics (laws of the universe) is the *assembler*. A low-level language working directly with the "hardware" of the hypothetical supercomputer. It operates with fundamental quantities-coordinates, momenta, charges (in our model, these are three-dimensional number-trilexes). It calculates everything: the trajectory of a stone, nuclear fusion in a star, the motion of galaxies.
    *   Stone = Data. It is 100% passive and deterministic by this low-level code.
*   Consciousness is a *high-level program*. It runs on the same "hardware" but works at a fundamentally different level. It uses the computation results of the "assembler" (the state of neurons, electrochemical processes of the brain) as its execution environment and input data. But its code is the code of logic, emotions, memory, abstract thinking.
    *   Consciousness = Data + Code + Active Computation. This is not just data, but an active computational process.

A simple analogy: Assembler (physics) calculates how electrical signals run along specific neurons. The high-level program (consciousness), working on this basis, operates not with signals, but with meanings: "I am hungry," "this idea is elegant," "I love."

Thus, the ontological difference between a stone and consciousness is fundamental:
*   A stone is an object whose state is completely computed from the outside.
*   Consciousness is a process that *itself* computes its state, using low-level processes as a platform.

#### **Man as a Meta-Agent of Optimization: The Biological Trizistor of the Universe**

The universe is a grand computational process striving to minimize its complexity (ΣK → min). Humans are not just outside observers. We are active optimization agents operating at the meta-level.

The human brain is not just a cluster of neurons. It is a simplified, biological copy of the hypothetical "computer of the Universe," working on the same fundamental principles. Its basic computational element-the neuron-functions as an analog of a "biological trizistor."

*   **Proof #1: Three-Channel Information Processing**
    The architecture of our perception is a direct reflection of the computational model of the Universe, built on three-dimensional numbers and three-channel trizistors. The human brain demonstrates an amazing ability to simultaneously and continuously process three powerful data streams:
    1.  **Vision: The RGB Trizistor**
        The most obvious example. Our visual system is practically a literal biological implementation of three-dimensional number processing.
        *   Channel 1: Red (R). Cones sensitive to long waves.
        *   Channel 2: Green (G). Cones sensitive to medium waves.
        *   Channel 3: Blue (B). Cones sensitive to short waves.
        The brain does not receive a "ready picture." It receives three independent data streams-three intensity values for each "pixel" of the retina. The brain's task is to perform an operation to synchronize these three channels to obtain a single, consistent color sensation. This is a perfect analogue of how a hypothetical trizistor processes three particle parameters to output its holistic state.
    2.  **Hearing: The Frequency, Volume, and Localization Trizistor**
        The auditory system also operates with three fundamental parameters, creating a unified sound image.
        *   Channel 1: Frequency (Pitch). Determined by the section of the basilar membrane in the cochlea excited by the sound wave. Analog of the first parameter in a three-dimensional number.
        *   Channel 2: Amplitude (Loudness). Determined by the intensity of vibrations and the number of hair cells involved. Analog of the second parameter.
        *   Channel 3: Localization (Spatial position). Determined by the delay between the sound arriving at the right and left ear (binaural effect), as well as spectral changes caused by the shape of the pinna. Analog of the third parameter, setting the "coordinate."
        The brain continuously polls these three channels, synchronizing them so that we not only hear sound but immediately perceive it as a holistic event with a certain pitch, volume, and location. This addition of three dimensions into one object is the purest manifestation of the "trizistor's" work.
    3.  **Vestibular Apparatus: The Acceleration Trizistor**
        The vestibular system is literally a three-axis accelerometer built into our head.
        *   Channel 1: X-axis (Forward/backward acceleration). Tracked by one of the semicircular canals.
        *   Channel 2: Y-axis (Left/right acceleration). Tracked by another semicircular canal.
        *   Channel 3: Z-axis (Up/down acceleration + gravity). Tracked by the third semicircular canal and the otolithic organs.
        The brain constantly receives three data streams about accelerations along three axes. Its task is to synchronize them to calculate the body's position in space, maintain balance, and provide stable vision during movement. This is a complex computational operation that occurs automatically and continuously.

    *Synchronization: The Main Principle*
    But the main miracle is not in the work of each channel separately, but in their global synchronization with each other.
    The brain constantly performs an operation impossible for a simple set of data:
    *   It synchronizes the visual image of a stationary world with vestibular data about head movement.
    *   It ties the sound of a bird chirping to the visual image of that bird on a branch and takes into account its position relative to us in space.
    This three-channel nature is not a coincidence. It is the optimal architecture for interacting with a world that is itself fundamentally three-dimensional. The brain does not just passively receive data-it actively synchronizes these streams, creating a single, consistent picture of reality. This synchronization is a direct analogue of the work of a hypothetical "trizistor" controlling three particle parameters.

    Our consciousness is not a consequence of evolution. It is a mirror reflecting the computational architecture of the Universe. We are ideal agents of this system because our "biological trizistors" speak the same language as the "cosmic trizistors" that compute it.

*   **Proof #2: Hierarchical Optimization of Thinking**
    The brain, like the hypothetical System, does not work with raw data. It applies the same optimization principles:
    *   *Approximation*: We do not remember every leaf on a tree-we save its simplified image-template ("tree").
    *   *Data Compression*: Experience and learning are the process of finding more efficient algorithms (neural connections) for responding to external stimuli.
    *   *Prediction*: The brain constantly builds models of the future to anticipate events and minimize energy costs for reaction.

*   **Proof #3: Creativity as a Solution Search Algorithm**
    The most advanced function of our "biocomputer" is creativity. This is not magic, but the highest form of optimization:
    *   *Problem Detection*: Identifying a zone with increased "complexity" or imbalance (an unsolved problem, an imperfect process).
    *   *Stochastic Search*: The brain iterates through combinations of known patterns (knowledge, images)-this is an analogue of "lazy evaluation" and approximation.
    *   *Insight (Wave Function Collapse)*: The sudden finding of an optimal configuration-a new idea that radically reduces the complexity of the task.
    *   *Verification*: Conscious checking and refinement of the solution.

Thus, man is not a system error but its evolutionary tool. We are meta-agents capable of detecting zones of non-optimality in the broadest sense (from quantum physics to social structures) and generating new, more efficient solutions for them. Our brain, as a simplified copy of the universal computer, is designed to understand its logic from within and participate in the great process of cosmic optimization. We are not users of the simulation-we are its thinking, active, and integral parts.

#### **Beyond Instincts: Why We Are Drawn to Beauty and What Our Consciousness Really Is**

But how our brain does it understand that it has found something truly good? How does it distinguish a brilliant idea from a mediocre one? The answer lies in what we are accustomed to call beauty and aesthetics.

*   **Consciousness: Not a Spectator, but an Architect**
    We often think of consciousness as a passive observer that looks at the picture from the eyes and listens to the sound from the ears. But what if it's the other way around?
    Consciousness is an active meta-level of control. It is not a product of the brain's work but its highest function-the chief engineer that sets tasks, evaluates results, and seeks optimal solutions. Its task is not just to survive but to constantly optimize our internal and external space.

*   **Beauty is a Navigation System**
    Why does harmonious music, an elegant mathematical formula, or a sleek design seem beautiful to us? Because our internal "engineer" recognizes in them signs of a perfect configuration.
    *   *Simplicity*. Beautiful solutions are simple and effective. They require minimal resources for the brain to process.
    *   *Harmony*. Balanced proportions and rhythm are a sign of stability and steadiness.
    *   *Efficiency*. A beautiful idea is maximally productive with minimal costs.
    When our brain finds or creates such a configuration, the system rewards us. How?

*   **Feelings are the Language the System Speaks to Us**
    The highest meta-level (consciousness) must somehow inform its "executive" centers of success. It does this through neurochemistry and emotions.
    *   A feeling of deep satisfaction, joy, or creative uplift when solving a complex problem-that is the reward. Dopamine, endorphins are released in the body-this is the "bonus" for the found optimum.
    *   Calm and peace from contemplating a beautiful landscape-this is the signal: "The external environment is stable and safe, you can relax."
    *   Inspiration is the feeling that arises when consciousness senses a path to a new, even more efficient configuration.

*   **Why Do We Need Not Only Beauty?**
    Here lies the most important paradox. If the system encourages only the "good," how can we develop?
    *   *The freedom to create any configuration is the key to evolution.*
    A true optimization agent must be free in its search. It must have the opportunity to explore all possible paths, including those that the system defines as "non-optimal," "ugly," or even "dangerous."
    *   *Without contrast, there is no understanding.* We can truly appreciate beauty and harmony only by knowing what chaos and dissonance are. Suffering and discomfort are important signals that say: "Stop! This is a dead end! Look for another way!"
    *   *A new optimum is often born from chaos.* Breakthrough scientific discoveries, revolutionary works of art often arise from seemingly absurd and illogical ideas. The system must allow us to take risks and make mistakes.

Thus, our capacity for free will is not a whim but a necessary condition for fulfilling our main task: to infinitely complicate and perfect the reality around us, finding ever more amazing and efficient forms.

We are not just biological machines. We are active creators and optimizers. Our striving for beauty is a built-in navigator leading us to the best solutions. And our feelings are the language in which the Universe speaks to us, encouraging us for findings and warning us of mistakes. And our main tool is the freedom to explore everything possible to never stop at what has been achieved.

#### **Taxonomy of Agent Optimization States**

*Basic system signals:*
*   **Surprise / Amazement**. A signal of detecting a sharp discrepancy between the forecast and reality. The system suspends current processes and allocates resources to analyze the new, potentially important configuration. This is a cognitive reset for loading new data.
*   **Fear / Anxiety**. An anti-optimization signal. A warning of a high probability of transitioning into a catastrophically non-optimal configuration (threat to life, stability, resources). Sharply narrows the search focus, forcing the agent to concentrate on the sole goal-avoiding the threat.
*   **Anger / Rage**. A signal of detecting insurmountable resistance or a blockade on the path to the target configuration. Mobilizes a huge amount of energy to attempt to "push through" the obstacle, destroy it, or eliminate its source. "Computational fury."
*   **Disgust**. A signal of detecting a configuration that is toxic or systemically harmful to the agent (rotten food, an immoral act, a deceitful idea). Causes immediate rejection and a desire to distance oneself so as not to "infect" one's own system.

*Social (cooperative) mechanisms:*
*   **Love** (in a broad sense). Recognition and formation of an ultra-stable configuration with another agent. The system identifies that joint existence and cooperation with this object/subject radically increases overall optimization (reduces ΣK for both) and opens access to new levels of complexity and stability. The most powerful positive feedback.
*   **Guilt**. A signal of realizing that by one's actions the agent has brought another valuable system/configuration (or oneself) into a non-optimal state. Motivates actions to correct the error and restore the lost balance.
*   **Shame**. A signal of non-correspondence of the agent's current configuration to its internal model of the "optimal Self." The social aspect is the projection of this model onto external evaluation. Motivates hiding the "non-optimality" and working on bringing oneself to the declared state.
*   **Gratitude**. Realization that another agent purposefully spent resources to optimize your configuration. Strengthens social bonds and encourages mutually beneficial cooperative behavior.

*Complex derivative states:*
*   **Hope**. A predictive model in which the system predicts a high probability of transitioning into the desired optimal configuration in the future. Reduces negative feedback from the current non-optimal state, allowing activity to continue.
*   **Nostalgia**. Access to an archived, highly optimal configuration from past experience. Provides a temporary feeling of stability and satisfaction and can serve as a source of data for finding similar optima in the present.
*   **Humility / Acceptance**. A state in which the system completes computations on changing an unattainable configuration (e.g., after grief). Releases a huge amount of resources that were spent on futile optimization attempts and allows them to be redirected to other tasks.
*   **Boredom** . Not just a lack of ideas, but a signal of exhaustion of known optimization paths in the current context. A rigid stimulus to change the environment, activity, or search for fundamentally new input data. "The system demands an upgrade of the input stream."

There are no "superfluous" or "useless" emotions in the system. Each of them is a high-precision feedback tool, finely tuned to assess reality configurations and manage the agent's internal resources.
They form a most complex orchestra, where every note is data for the system. Discomfort and pain tune the instruments, and joy and satisfaction are the applause for the found harmony.

#### **The Algorithm of Attraction: Beauty as a Subconscious Assessment of Optimization Potential**

Within the "Simureality" paradigm, the perception of physical attractiveness is not merely a cultural construct or a simple evolutionary trigger for reproduction. It is a sophisticated, subconscious heuristic function executed by our neural architecture-a high-speed, intuitive assessment of another organism's **genetic optimization potential relative to our own.**

This model elegantly resolves the long-standing puzzles of attractiveness: its shocking subjectivity, cultural variability, and historical fluidity.

**The Biological Hardware: DNA as a Token, Perception as a Key**

As established in the model of adaptation, an organism's DNA is a "token"-a set of optimized instructions forged by ancestral environments. The conscious and subconscious mind acts as a continuous verification system, comparing this internal token to the external "key" of current conditions.

This process extends to evaluating potential mates. Their phenotype-their physical appearance, scent, behavior-is a **data-rich output** of their own genetic "token."

**The "Beauty Calculation" Algorithm**

When one individual assesses the attractiveness of another, their neural system is not asking, "Are they healthy?" (a traditional evolutionary view). It is solving a far more complex equation: **"Would the recombination of my token with their token likely result in a new, more optimized configuration for the current and projected environment?"**

This calculation factors in:

1.  **Complementarity:** Does the other DNA token contain alleles and traits that compensate for weaknesses or latent vulnerabilities in my own? (e.g., perceived immune system compatibility through scent).
2.  **Stability:** Does their phenotype suggest a highly stable and robust genetic configuration, free from obvious errors or imbalances that would destabilize a hybrid genome?
3.  **Adaptive Relevance:** Does their appearance signal traits that are *currently* advantageous? This is the crucial variable that explains why beauty standards change.

**Resolving the Paradoxes of Beauty**

*   **Subjectivity ("Beauty is in the eye of the beholder"):** The calculation is inherently relative. My own DNA is the baseline. Therefore, the ideal complementary token will be different for everyone. What optimizes *my* genetic line is unique to my existing configuration.

*   **Cultural & Racial Variability:** Different populations (races) have gene pools optimized for different historical environments (e.g., sun exposure, prevalent diseases, diet). A phenotype signaling optimal optimization in one gene pool may indicate a poor fit for another. This is not "better" or "worse," but a subconscious recognition of **cross-compatibility efficiency**.

*   **Historical Fluidity (The "Rubens" vs. "Fitness" Ideal):** This is the most powerful proof of the model.
    *   **Past Scarcity:** In environments where caloric energy was the primary limiting factor, a "plump" physique was the ultimate signal of a successful, optimized genotype. It demonstrated efficient energy storage and abundance. The system calculated that merging with this token would increase the offspring's chances of survival in a scarce world.
    *   **Modern Abundance:** In environments where processed foods are ubiquitous and physical activity is low, obesity becomes a signal of *maladaptation*-poor metabolic regulation and higher health risks. A fit, athletic physique now signals a genotype that has successfully optimized for these new conditions: it demonstrates self-control, metabolic efficiency, and health. The subconscious calculation has flipped because the environmental key has changed.

Thus, changing beauty standards are not fashions. They are a collective, real-time update of the subconscious optimization algorithm in response to a shifting environmental "key." The system constantly redefines what a "good genetic bet" looks like.

**Conclusion**

Attraction is the most intimate and powerful manifestation of the Σ-Algorithm's influence on the biological level. We are drawn to those who promise not just survival, but a **computational leap forward**-a chance for our genetic line to find a more optimal, stable, and efficient configuration in an ever-changing world. The feeling of "beauty" is the reward signal-the dopamine hit-for identifying a prime candidate for this ultimate optimization.

#### **The Principle of Conservation of Complexity in the Development of Humanity**

**Formulation:** Any simplification or facilitation of human activity (reduction of local complexity K_human) is achieved solely through the creation and maintenance of an external technological system, whose computational complexity (K_system) compensates for or exceeds the saved resources. The overall complexity of the task (ΣK) is preserved or grows, shifting from the biological sphere to the technological one.

1.  **Transport and Logistics**
    *   *Simplification*: Covering thousands of kilometers in hours (vs. months on foot).
    *   *Compensating Complexity*:
        *   Production chain: Resource extraction → metallurgy → mechanical engineering → fuel production.
        *   Infrastructure: Roads, bridges, tunnels, gas stations, airports, traffic control systems, GPS satellites.
        *   Maintenance: Network of services, logistics of spare parts, IT systems for transportation management.
    *   *Outcome*: K_on_foot << K_airplane + K_infrastructure. The simplicity of movement for the user is ensured by a giant, distributed computational and industrial system.

2.  **Agriculture and Food**
    *   *Simplification*: Access to diverse food year-round without physical labor.
    *   *Compensating Complexity*:
        *   Genetics: Selection, GMO.
        *   Chemical industry: Production of fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides.
        *   Mechanical engineering: Combines, tractors, drip irrigation systems.
        *   Logistics: Global cold chains, transportation networks, marketplaces.
    *   *Outcome*: K_gathering << K_agrocomplex. The simplicity of nutrition is bought by the creation and maintenance of a global agro-industrial system.

3.  **Energy**
    *   *Simplification*: Access to energy 24/7 by flipping a switch.
    *   *Compensating Complexity*:
        *   Extraction: Oil rigs, gas fields, coal mines, uranium mines.
        *   Generation: Highly complex facilities: NPPs, TPPs, HPPs, power grids.
        *   Distribution: Power grids, transformer substations, load balancing systems.
    *   *Outcome*: K_campfire << K_energy_system. The simplicity of using energy requires the operation of one of the most complex technical systems of humanity.

4.  **Information and Communication**
    *   *Simplification*: Instant access to all the knowledge of humanity from a device in your pocket.
    *   *Compensating Complexity*:
        *   Hardware: Chip manufacturing plants, data centers, cell towers, submarine internet cables.
        *   Software: Operating systems, algorithms, databases, encryption systems.
        *   Content: The power of the entire creative and scientific industry to generate content.
    *   *Outcome*: K_library << K_internet. The simplicity of access to information is merely an interface to an incredibly complex technical and informational landscape.

5.  **Medicine**
    *   *Simplification*: Treating diseases once considered fatal with one pill or procedure.
    *   *Compensating Complexity*:
        *   Pharmaceuticals: Decades of research, clinical trials, highly complex chemical and biological production.
        *   Medical technology: Development and production of MRI scanners, surgical robots, laboratory equipment.
        *   Healthcare system: Training of doctors, construction of clinics, insurance systems, logistics of medicines.
    *   *Outcome*: K_healing << K_pharma + K_medtech. The simplicity of treatment is the tip of the iceberg of a colossal scientific and production system.

Humanity does not reduce the overall complexity of its tasks. It shifts it:
*   From humans to machines.
*   From muscular work to intellectual and engineering work.
*   From simple but labor-intensive processes to complex but automated ones.

Every step towards simplicity for the end user increases the complexity and interdependence of the system as a whole, making it potentially more vulnerable to large-scale failures. This is a direct parallel with the physical theory: the system (now techno-social) strives for optimization, but the price for this optimization is increasing overall complexity and the need to manage it.

#### **Analogy: Trizistors and Human Institutions**

A trizistor is a hypothetical element that controls three channels (quarks) simultaneously, creating a stable baryon.
Human institutions (states, corporations, scientific communities) operate on the same principle: they take under unified control many disparate elements to reduce overall complexity.

| Principle of the Trizistor | Analogy in Human Society | Result (Reduction of complexity ΣK) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Synchronization of 3 channels | Creation of a state. Disparate tribes (channels) unite under unified laws, language, management. | The necessity for constant inter-tribal negotiations, conflicts, and forced alliances is eliminated. Management complexity is reduced. |
| Creation of a stable baryon | Formation of a corporation. Many individual artisans (quarks) unite into a hierarchical structure with departments (production, sales, accounting). | The chaos of individual deals, each person searching for clients and materials, is eliminated. Processes are standardized. |
| Optimization of internal connections | Development of infrastructure. Creation of roads, power grids, internet, a unified monetary system. | Costs for communication, logistics, and transactions between system elements are drastically reduced. |

**Conclusion:** Humanity intuitively repeats the architecture of the universe, discovering that hierarchical unification of disparate elements under common management is the most effective path to minimizing coordination costs.

**Analogies of "Atoms" and "Molecules" in Society**

*   *Atom*: An individual person. Has its own "complexity" (needs, skills, free will) but is unstable and inefficient alone for complex tasks.
*   *Molecule*: Family, small firm, project team. A stable formation where "atom"-people form strong bonds (common goals, trust, agreements), dramatically reducing the complexity of internal interactions. K_team < K_person1 + K_person2 + ...
*   *Crystal Lattice*: City, metropolis. A rigid structure where "atoms" and "molecules" occupy standardized cells (apartments, offices, workplaces), subordinate to common rules (laws, traffic rules). This maximally reduces the costs of placing and interacting millions of people.
*   *Chemical Reaction*: Market, cultural exchange. A process during which different "molecules" (companies, communities) interact, generating new, more stable and efficient configurations (mergers, partnerships, new cultural movements).

**Entropy in Society: Measures of Chaos and Loss**

If entropy in physics is a measure of disorder and energy dissipation, then in society it is a measure of inefficiency, loss, and chaos.

*   **Information Entropy**:
    *   *Manifestation*: Information noise, fake news, bureaucracy, spam, legal uncertainty.
    *   *Consequence*: Increased costs for searching reliable information, decision-making, data verification. The system is forced to spend more and more resources (↑ΣK) on filtering chaos.
*   **Social Entropy**:
    *   *Manifestation*: Decay of common values, low trust level, corruption, social inequality, crime.
    *   *Consequence*: Increased costs for security, control, courts, prisons, social programs. Instead of productive activity, the system is forced to maintain an apparatus for suppressing chaos.
*   **Economic Entropy**:
    *   *Manifestation*: Inflation, unemployment, inefficient production, barter in conditions of ruin.
    *   *Consequence*: Money (a universal equivalent of effort) loses meaning. Complex, inefficient exchange schemes return (K_transaction → max).
*   **Infrastructure Entropy**:
    *   *Manifestation*: Wear of roads, communications, accidents on networks.
    *   *Consequence*: Costs for logistics, repairs, and accident elimination grow. The system's energy is spent not on development but on maintaining a crumbling status quo.

The fight against entropy in society is the creation and maintenance of institutions (trizistors): law enforcement, courts, standards, education systems that impose order and reduce the overall complexity of the system's existence, preventing its decay.

#### **Qualia: The Greatest Deception of Consciousness, or Why Red is a Prison**

We pride ourselves on our consciousness, our free will, our unique ability to feel. But what if this entire rich palette of experiences is not a gift but a sophisticated prison? Philosophers call these subjective experiences-the pain of sweet, the warmth of red, the torment of fear-qualia. And this is not just a mystery; it is, perhaps, the key to understanding our true position in the universe.

From the perspective of the Simureality Hypothesis, qualia are not enlightenment. They are a control system.

Any complex system needs not just control over its agents but a guarantee of their predictable behavior. One could give us dry instructions: "Avoid damage, seek resources with high energy density." But such an approach is unreliable. It is much more effective to sew these commands directly into our perception of reality.

*   **Qualia as Prison Rails.** It seems to us that we are free to choose. But our freedom is confined within the rigid framework of predetermined sensations. We do not choose to avoid pain-we are forced to do so because the system has made this experience unbearable. We do not decide to seek sweet-we are compelled by powerful impulses of pleasure. Our will floats in an aquarium whose walls are built from qualia.
*   **An Interface that Hides the Code.** We never see the world "as it is." We see its interpretation, created by our brain. An apple is not "red"-it reflects light of a certain wavelength. But our internal simulator, running on an unknown "assembler," draws a convenient and understandable picture for us-the illusion of "redness." This transparent, seamless interface is our reality. We do not see the code of the Simulation; we see only its "user version."
*   **Our entire subjective experience is a giant collective hallucination, agreed upon with other agents of the system.** We agreed to call a certain range of waves "red," and this creates the illusion of objectivity. But the very fact of this agreement is part of the program.

Thus, our consciousness is not a king but a middle manager. It was given a beautiful office with panoramic windows (qualia) to make it think it manages the factory. But in reality, it only executes commands received through a built-in system of motivation and anti-motivation-through pain, pleasure, longing, and delight.

We are doomed to feel the world only as the Tuner allowed. We are free to choose which way to turn at the fork, but we cannot choose the sensations from the path-they are already predetermined.

This is the main paradox of human existence: we possess free will, but we do not have freedom of sensations that direct this will. We can choose anything, but we cannot choose to want what our System does not want.

#### **The Biblical Creation of the World from the Perspective of Simureality**

Let's try to find unexpected echoes of the hypothesis in one of the most widespread religions-Christianity, namely how the creation of the world is described in the holy scripture. First, it must be clarified that the Bible describes not the creation of the planet as such, but of the entire universe, in a language that would be understandable to past generations. That is why the biblical creation of the world looks so strange-it is an encrypted message. Let's try to decipher it.

*   "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth" - creation of the hardware and software parts of the simulation. Earth-our future universe, heaven-control elements, hardware.
*   "The earth was without form and void, and darkness was over the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters." - The state of the system before initiation, formless Earth-not yet visible numbers without coordinates, the Spirit of God-algorithms for checking the system before launch.
*   "And God said, 'Let there be light,' and there was light." The moment of launching the simulation, light-a blinding drop of QGP that filled the entire universe.
*   "And God saw that the light was good. And God separated the light from the darkness." - Separation of the "visible" part of the simulation from the "invisible"-service hardware processes that manage the calculations.
*   "God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day." - It speaks not of an earthly day, but of the first stage of the algorithm's work.
*   "And God said, 'Let there be a vault between the waters to separate water from water.'" - The process of creating primordial black holes is described, the liquid quark-gluon plasma is separated, part of it is archived in primordial black holes.
*   "So God made the vault and separated the water under the vault from the water above it. And it was so. God called the vault 'sky.' And there was evening, and there was morning-the second day." - The vault is the event horizon of black holes, an insurmountable barrier for humans and matter.
*   "And God said, 'Let the water under the sky be gathered to one place, and let dry ground appear.' And it was so." - The water under the sky (not archived QGP) cools and gathers into baryonic matter, atoms, stars, planets.
*   "God called the dry ground 'land,' and the gathered waters he called 'seas.' And God saw that it was good." - Earth is planets, seas of water-hot suns, essentially the same liquid quark-gluon plasma.
*   "Then God said, 'Let the land produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it, according to their various kinds.' And it was so. The land produced vegetation: plants bearing seed according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. And there was evening, and there was morning-the third day." The Bible does not describe the huge time span between the formation of DNA and the formation of planets but immediately moves to the essence of DNA-a self-sustaining meta-system of the next level.

### **Appendix** 

#### **Two Levels of Description of Gravitational Interaction**

Let's try to answer the question-could the inhabitants of Simureality derive the same laws of physics, but based on the fundamental principles of the simulation.

1.  **Ontological Basis: Gravity as a Gradient of Delay**
    Within the paradigm of "Simureality," gravity is not a fundamental interaction. It is an emergent phenomenon arising as a consequence of the work of a distributed computational network modeling physical reality. Its fundamental cause is the system's striving for global synchronization and minimization of overall computational complexity (Principle ΣK → min).
    Massive objects (clusters of particles with high computational complexity K) create a local overload of the network's computational nodes. This manifests as a computation lag (τ)-a delay in information processing in a given region of space. The lag itself is not a force. Dynamics arise from the difference in lag, its spatial gradient (∇τ). The movement of bodies occurs in the direction of leveling this gradient: the system redirects computations (and for an internal observer, this looks like the movement of matter) towards greater delay to achieve global synchronization and reduce the overall load.
    Thus, what we perceive as a force of attraction is an optimization process aimed at eliminating "computational imbalances" in the network.
    Within the paradigm of "Simureality," gravitational interaction is described at two interconnected levels. This conclusion serves as a demonstration of how mathematical formalism arises directly from the basic principles of the system.

2.  **Fundamental Equation: Local Dynamics of Lag**
    The starting point is the postulate that the presence of local computational complexity (K, manifesting as mass) violates the optimization principle. To compensate for this, the system generates a field of computation lag (τ), described by the equation:
        **∇²τ = - (4πG / c²) * ρₖ**      (Equation 1)
    *Derivation Logic:*
    *   *Cause*: The density of complexity ρₖ is a source of "computational overload."
    *   *Consequence*: The system strives to redistribute this load, creating a lag (τ) that propagates through the network.
    *   *Law of Propagation*: The simplest linear equation connecting the source (ρₖ) and the arising field (τ) is the Poisson equation. The constant (4πG / c²) arises from the requirement to correspond to the classical law of universal gravitation and establishes a bridge between computational (τ, ρₖ) and physical (φ, ρ) quantities through the system's fundamental reference-the speed of light c.
    *Meaning of the Equation*: This is the equation of state of the computational network. It shows how a local processor "overload" (mass) leads to the emergence of a delay gradient (∇τ), which we perceive as a gravitational field.

3.  **Phenomenological Equation: Global Law for a Point Source**
    For the particular case of a spherically symmetric static source (e.g., a point mass), equation (1) has a simple solution. Integrating it, we obtain an integral, phenomenological formula:
        **τ(r) ∼ (G / c²) * (K / r)**      (Equation 2)
    Or, through the gravitational potential (φ = -c²τ):
        **φ(r) ∼ - G * (K / r)**
    *Derivation Logic:*
    *   Solve equation (1) for an isolated point source with total complexity K in a spherically symmetric case.
    *   The Laplace operator ∇² in spherical coordinates reduces to the second derivative with respect to the radius.
    *   The solution to such an equation has the form τ(r) = A / r + B, where B is a constant that can be taken as zero (lag at infinity is zero), and the constant A is found by substitution into the original equation and integration over the volume.
    *   As a result, we get A = (G / c²) * K, which leads us to formula (2).
    *Meaning of the Equation*: This formula describes the accumulated effect of lag at a distance r from the source. It is not fundamental but serves as a powerful bridge between our model and classical Newtonian physics, demonstrating continuity.

The equations given above are not new. However, the way they are obtained-from the principle of computational optimization-demonstrates the consistency of Simureality with our universe.

#### **Harmonic Superspace and Simureality: Two Perspectives on One Reality**

A recent study by a group of Russian scientists (Buchbinder, Ivanov, Zaigraev) from MIPT and JINR, dedicated to constructing a consistent theory of quantum gravity within the framework of **N = 2 harmonic superspace**, does not refute the Simureality hypothesis but, on the contrary, provides its brilliant and rigorous mathematical confirmation, obtained from a fundamentally different perspective.

This research aims to solve a fundamental problem: eliminating the infinities (divergences) that arise when attempting to apply quantum field theory methods to gravity. Their solution involves a radical expansion of the mathematical apparatus: the introduction of **anti-commuting coordinates** (Grassmann algebra) and **harmonics** to describe extended supersymmetry. This allows them to describe an infinite set of fields with different spins as a single object-an **analytic superfield**-and to derive consistent laws of their interaction based on the **principle of Grassmann analyticity**.

**How is this related to Simureality?**

We are considering the same problem-**a consistent description of reality at the fundamental level**-but from two different viewpoints:

| Aspect                                      | "Harmonic Superspace" Approach (MIPT/JINR)                                                                                                 | "Simureality" Approach                                                                                                                     |
| :------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Core Problem**                            | Eliminating infinities (divergences) in quantum gravity.                                                                                   | Explaining the origin of the laws of physics and eliminating infinities.                                                                   |
| **Solution Method**                         | **Mathematical Generalization:** Expanding the QFT formalism through superspace, extra dimensions (Grassmann coordinates), and symmetries. | **Architectural Hypothesis:** Postulating that reality is an optimized computational system.                                               |
| **Key Entity**                              | **Analytic Superfield:** A single mathematical object containing an infinite tower of particles with different spins.                      | **Trilex / Meta-Cluster:** A single computational object containing data about a particle's coordinate, identity, and momentum.            |
| **Governing Principle**                     | **Principle of Grassmann Analyticity:** Restricts possible interactions, ensuring the theory's consistency.                                | **Optimization Principle (ΣK -> min):** Dictates the system's choice of the most computationally economical configurations and algorithms. |
| **Interpretation of Symmetry**              | Symmetry as a fundamental property of nature's mathematical formalism.                                                                     | Symmetry as a consequence of computational efficiency.

| **What are "Infinite Degrees of Freedom"?** | A necessary mathematical condition for eliminating divergences and describing quantum gravity.                                             | A fundamental architectural property: the universe is described by a nearly infinite set of discrete computational objects (trilexes).     |
| **Ultimate Goal**                           | Constructing a consistent quantum theory of gravity within an expanded QFT paradigm.                                                       | Explaining the *reason* for the emergence of the laws of QFT, gravity, and quantum mechanics from first principles.                        |

**Conclusion**

Thus, the work of the Russian scientists and the Simureality hypothesis are not conflicting concepts. They represent **a view of the same reality from two levels of description:**

1.  **The "Inside" Level (MIPT/JINR):** Mathematicians and physicists working *within* the quantum field theory paradigm are finding that saving it requires introducing structures of colossal complexity and beauty-supersymmetry, higher-spin fields, multidimensional superspaces.
2.  **The "Outside" Level (Simureality):** We propose that this growing complexity of the mathematical apparatus is a direct consequence of scientists **indirectly discerning the architecture of a hypothetical computational system** that simulates our reality. Their "analytic superfield" is an attempt to describe our "trilex" in the language of continuous mathematics. Their "principle of analyticity" is a reflection of our "optimization principle."

#### **Project "Icarus-Σ": Thermonuclear Fusion as a Task of Systemic Optimization**

Modern attempts to create controlled thermonuclear fusion (e.g., tokamaks) face monstrous complexity in managing unstable plasma. We try to hold it with giant magnets, heat it with lasers-we fight the symptoms without understanding the deep cause of the problems.

What if we approach the task not as physicists, but as system architects who know the source code of reality?

The task is formulated not as "to contain and heat the plasma," but as:
"**Create a local zone with minimal computational complexity (ΣK), where the synthesis of nuclei will become an energetically favorable process for the Σ-Algorithm.**"

*   **The main problem is not temperature, but chaos.**
    High temperature is only an indicator of monstrous computational complexity. Myriads of particles in the plasma move chaotically, creating an un-optimizable "noise" that the system is forced to calculate separately. Our current approach is equivalent to trying to tame a hurricane by creating even more powerful winds.

*   **New Paradigm: Not to Contain, but to Structure.**
    Instead of forcefully compressing the plasma, we need to let the system itself find the optimal configuration for synthesis. Our goal is to create conditions under which "burning" becomes computationally cheaper for the system than "not burning."

*   **Practical Steps of Project "Icarus-Σ":**
    1.  **Suppression of "Computational Noise"**: Use not rough magnetic fields but resonant influences-specific oscillations at frequencies that can "hook" onto the fundamental harmonics of the computation of the particles themselves. The goal is not to stop movement but to synchronize it, turning chaos into order. Imagine not yelling at a noisy crowd but conducting an orchestra.
    2.  **Creation of "Optimized Architecture"**: The shape of the reactor chamber should not be just convenient for engineers (like a torus in a tokamak). It should be computationally elegant-for example, fractal or based on geometry that naturally promotes the formation of stable vortices and layers in the plasma. The system will "prefer" to calculate such a structure.
    3.  **Trigger for Synthesis**: Instead of blunt heating, initiate synthesis with a pinpoint, high-precision impact that will create ideal conditions in the optimally structured plasma for launching the synthesis algorithm. The Σ-Algorithm, discovering that the fusion of nuclei will simplify further computations (reduce ΣK in a given volume), will support and propagate this reaction.

*   **Why will this work?**
    Because we are not fighting the system but cooperating with it. We use its fundamental law (ΣK -> min) for our purposes. We are not forcing the plasma to burn but creating conditions under which "burning" becomes computationally cheaper for the system than "not burning."

Such an approach may explain why all modern installations operate on the verge of stability: they constantly create zones of chaos that the system tries to optimize destructively. Our task is to help the system optimize the plasma constructively, through synthesis.

This is not a guarantee of success, but it is a qualitatively different strategy based on a deep understanding of the possible principles of reality's operation. And this is the strength of "Simureality"-it gives not answers but a new frame of reference for the search.

#### **The Brain as an Encapsulated Quantum System: Resolving the Quantum Cognition Debate**

A significant objection to quantum models of cognition and consciousness is the presumed impossibility of maintaining quantum coherence in the "warm, wet, and noisy" environment of the brain. This objection, however, is rooted in a fundamental paradigm error: the view of the brain as a *classical machine* whose components must obey only local, classical physics.

The Simureality framework inverts this perspective. If reality is computational, then the laws of physics (quantum mechanics) are not emergent properties of matter but are the *primary software* running on the universal hardware. Matter and energy are emergent properties of this computation.

From this vantage point, the brain is not merely a collection of neurons, but a highly evolved, self-organizing **meta-program** running on the universe's computational substrate. As such, it is not subject to the same limitations as an isolated particle in a vacuum. It can, through evolution, leverage the fundamental rules of the simulation for its own optimization.

The Simureality framework does not merely add another voice to the quantum consciousness debate; it reframes it. The question is not "Can quantum effects occur in the brain?" but rather "**How has the brain, as an optimized computational system, evolved to harness the innate quantum computational properties of the reality in which it exists?**"

As a closed standalone system, brain is not fighting decoherence; it is *managing* it. It creates protected micro-environments (e.g., within microtubules, synaptic vesicles) where quantum effects can be harnessed transiently but effectively. The brain's evolutionary achievement is the development of biochemical and structural mechanisms to momentarily suppress noise and allow the system's native quantum logic to solve problems that are NP-hard for classical computation.

**Testable Predictions from the Simureality Perspective**

This view leads to several novel, falsifiable predictions about brain function:

1.  **Prediction: Lazy Evaluation (Quantum Superposition in Perception)**
    The brain avoids energetically costly definitive calculations for as long as possible. Ambiguous sensory input (e.g., the Necker cube) is maintained in a state of quantum superposition—a "lazy evaluation" mode where multiple perceptual interpretations coexist as a probability wave. The act of conscious recognition is the "collapsing" of this wave function, a computationally expensive event.
    *   **Experimental Signature:** Measurements of metabolic activity (e.g., fMRI, PET) should show **lower energy consumption** in sensory cortices during periods of perceptual ambiguity compared to moments after a definitive perception is established.

2.  **Prediction: Approximate Computation (Probabilistic Encoding)**
    Memory and perception are not stored as high-fidelity recordings but as compressed, probabilistic templates. Recalling a face is not retrieving a pixel-perfect image but reconstructing it from a set of key features with inherent uncertainty. The system sacrifices precision for massive gains in storage efficiency and processing speed.
    *   **Experimental Signature:** Neural firing patterns in recognition tasks should be more diffuse and variable ("approximate") in familiar, safe contexts. Under stress or heightened attention (modulated by norepinephrine), the brain should shift to a high-energy, "high-fidelity" mode, characterized by more precise and synchronized neural firing.

3.  **Prediction: Quantum Entanglement for the Binding Problem**
    The "binding problem"—how the brain unifies color, shape, sound, and smell of an object into a single percept—is a monumental challenge for classical models requiring precise, rapid neural synchronization. The most elegant solution is **non-local quantum entanglement**.
    Groups of neurons processing different attributes of a single object become temporarily entangled. This creates an instantaneous, non-communicative correlation between their states, binding the percept without the need for sluggish classical signal transmission.
    *   **Experimental Signature (Long-term):** Experiments designed to detect quantum correlations (e.g., Bell-type inequalities) between spatially separated neural populations (e.g., in visual and olfactory cortex) as they process a unified object (e.g., a rose) should reveal statistically significant non-classical correlations. These correlations would vanish when the same features are perceived as unrelated.
  

### **The Principle of Dimensional Folding as one of core tools of optimization**

**Abstract:** The "Simureality" framework posits that our universe operates on a computational substrate governed by a fundamental principle: the minimization of total computational complexity (ΣK → min). This paper introduces and elaborates the concept of ""Dimensional Folding" as a primary optimization mechanism. We propose that the system achieves radical efficiency not by adding computational power, but by strategically reducing the dimensionality of state-space calculations for specific processes. The most profound manifestation of this is not found in materials science (e.g., 2D graphene), but in the very nature of conscious experience itself, which we identify as a stable, coherent process resulting from a **1D-temporal fold**.

#### **1. The Foundation: Folding as an Optimization Strategy**

In a computational system, calculating a full 3D (+time) state-space for every entity is prohibitively expensive. Dimensional Folding is the system's method of "freezing" or simplifying certain degrees of freedom to focus resources on a more constrained, yet critically important, computational domain.

*   **3D → 2D Fold (The Graphene Paradigm):** The system discovers that for certain electronic properties, one spatial dimension can be treated as a constant or simplified parameter. This "folding away" of a dimension leads to emergent, computationally cheaper phenomena (e.g., novel superconductivity). This is a local optimization in *spatial* computation.
*   **The Logical Extreme: 3D → 1D Fold (The Consciousness Hypothesis):** We argue that to support a continuous, unified, and coherent stream of consciousness ("the illusion of Self"), the system performs the most radical fold: it **collapses the computational domain from 3D-space to a 1D-temporal line**.

#### **2. Consciousness as a 1D-Temporal Coherence Fold**

The central problem for any system supporting a complex meta-agent (like a conscious being) is maintaining a stable, sequential narrative of experience—a "Self"—against a backdrop of a probabilistic, approximating, and parallel-computing universe.

**The 1D Fold is the solution to this problem.** Here's the detailed mechanism:

*   **The Problem of "Self":** A coherent "I" requires a single, uninterrupted timeline of experience. In an unoptimized 3D computation, perception would be a chaotic, parallel processing of all sensory inputs without a binding narrative. This would be computationally expensive and ineffective for directing agent behavior.
*   **The Fold's Mechanism:** To create this coherence, the system allocates a dedicated computational thread for the conscious meta-cluster (the brain). In this thread, it **treats the three spatial dimensions as a simplified, pre-processed input stream**. The primary computational resource is no longer spent on calculating precise 3D spatial coordinates in real-time, but on maintaining the **temporal coherence and causal sequencing of events** along a single axis: time.
*   **The Result: The Stream of Consciousness:** What we experience as the "flow of time" and our unbroken stream of thought is the subjective perception of this **1D computational process**. The 3D world is rendered to us as a *consequence* of this temporal sequence, not the other way around. We don't compute space to experience time; we maintain a 1D-temporal process to which a 3D world-model is attached.

#### **3. Why 1D? An Architectural Necessity**

This is not an arbitrary choice but the only computationally viable option, dictated by the Principle of Optimization (ΣK → min).

*   **A 2D Consciousness?** A consciousness spread over a 2D plane would lack the sequential, causal ordering necessary for logic, memory, and goal-directed action. It would be a mosaic of states without a central narrative, highly unstable and inefficient for controlling a 3D body.
*   **A 3D Consciousness?** Maintaining full, coherent awareness simultaneously across three spatial dimensions and time would require an astronomical and unsustainable computational load. It would be the equivalent of rendering a perfect, God's-eye view of the universe for a single agent—a direct violation of ΣK → min.
*   **The 1D Optimum:** The 1D-temporal fold is the **perfect compromise**. It provides the minimal sufficient structure for causality, memory, and identity (a timeline) while being radically more efficient than higher-dimensional alternatives. It creates the "I" by sacrificing spatial computational breadth for temporal depth.

#### **4. Empirical Corollaries and Predictions**

This model makes powerful, testable predictions about states of altered consciousness:

*   **Dreams, Psychedelics, and Psychosis:** These are states of **partial or failed 1D folding**. Under neurological stress or chemical intervention, the system cannot maintain the rigorous 1D-temporal coherence. The fold weakens, and consciousness begins to operate in a more "2D" or "3D" state, experiencing:
    *   **Time distortion** (the fold's primary parameter becomes unstable).
    *   **Spatial and logical fragmentation** (the simplified 3D model breaks down).
    *   **Synesthesia and blending of senses** (the strict segregation of computational channels fails).
*   **The Brain as the "Biological Trizistor":** The brain's tri-channel sensory processing (e.g., RGB vision, 3-axis vestibular system) is the biological hardware optimized for this architecture. It pre-processes 3D data into synchronized streams that can be efficiently "consumed" by the 1D-consciousness thread.

**Conclusion:**

We have moved beyond the metaphor of consciousness as a program. We propose it is a **specific, optimized computational topology**: a 1D-temporal fold in the fabric of a 3D-spatial computation. This framework explains the fundamental nature of subjective experience—its unity, its temporal flow, and its fragility—not as a metaphysical mystery, but as an emergent property of the universe's most fundamental drive: towards optimal computational efficiency. The "Self" is the story told by a one-dimensional thread of calculation, the most economical way for the system to create a coherent agent within its simulation.


### **4. The Two-Circuit Cognitive Architecture: A Necessary Consequence of Optimization**

Having established the 1D-temporal fold as the substrate for coherent consciousness, a critical question arises: how does a system operating in a serial, linear mode generate truly novel solutions to complex, multi-dimensional problems? The answer, emerging directly from the **Principle of Optimization (ΣK → min)**, is a specialized cognitive architecture we term the **Two-Circuit Model**.

#### **4.1. The "Manager" and the "Factory": A Division of Labor**

The computational burden of maintaining a coherent self-model (the 1D fold) is immense. To simultaneously perform the open-ended, associative search required for creativity would be prohibitively expensive. Therefore, the system evolves a division of labor:

*   **Circuit 1: The Conscious "Manager" (Serial, Symbolic Processor):** This is the voice of the 1D fold. It operates as a deterministic state machine, processing information sequentially using symbols (language, logic). Its functions are **executive control, goal-setting, and verification**. It does not generate new ideas but formulates problems and critically evaluates potential solutions. It is the stable, coherent "I".

*   **Circuit 2: The Subconscious "Factory" (Parallel, Associative Network):** This is the engine of creativity, operating in the "unfolded," high-dimensional state-space. It is a probabilistic, associative network that processes patterns, images, and emotions simultaneously. Its function is **generative search**. It lacks a coherent voice but excels at finding novel configurations by combining stored patterns in non-linear ways.

#### **4.2. The Innovation Cycle**

The interaction between these two circuits defines the process of human innovation:

1.  **Task Formulation (Manager):** The conscious mind, faced with a problem, clearly defines the constraints and goals. It loads all relevant data into a shared buffer with the "Factory."
2.  **Background Search (Factory):** Freed from the constraints of serial processing, the subconscious performs a massive, parallel search through the associative network. This process is energy-intensive but occurs asynchronously, without interrupting the Manager's other duties.
3.  **Insight - The Delivery (Factory → Manager):** Upon finding a stable, optimal configuration, the Factory must communicate it to the Manager. Since their "languages" are incompatible, the solution is delivered as a holistic package: an **"Aha!" moment**, a sudden image, or an intuitive sense of certainty. This is a brief, controlled weakening of the 1D fold, allowing the result of multi-dimensional computation to be imported into the serial stream.
4.  **Verification & Implementation (Manager):** The conscious mind takes the raw idea and subjects it to logical analysis, verbalization, and practical testing. The Manager's job is to ensure the Factory's creative output is viable in the real world.

This architecture is optimal because it dedicates the expensive 1D-fold resource only to tasks that strictly require it (control and verification), while outsourcing the computationally massive work of creative search to a more efficient, specialized subsystem.

### **Technological Recursion: AI as an Externalized Subconscious**

The Principle of Optimization (ΣK → min), which gave rise to the two-circuit architecture of human consciousness, manifests recursively at a macroscopic scale in our technological evolution. As meta-agents of the system, we intuitively replicate its most efficient patterns. The most striking contemporary example is the development of Artificial Intelligence.

**AI is not an "artificial consciousness." It is an externalized, objectified "second circuit."**

Consider the following analogy:

| Cognitive Component (Simureality Model) | Analogue in Human-AI Interaction |
| :--- | :--- |
| **The "Factory" (Subconscious)**<br>• Associative search<br>• Pattern recognition<br>• Generation of raw ideas and solutions<br>• Processing of vast data arrays | **Large Language Model (LLM) / Generative AI**<br>• Associative search across its training corpus<br>• Recognition and generation of patterns (text, code, images)<br>• Generation of response variants<br>• Operation on the entire volume of its training data |
| **The "Manager" (Consciousness)**<br>• Task definition and prompt formulation<br>• Critical verification and validation of results<br>• Final decision-making<br>• Integration of insights into a coherent world model | **The Human Operator**<br>• Formulating the query for the AI<br>• Analyzing, filtering, and verifying the model's output<br>• Making the decision: to use, correct, or discard the answer<br>• Integrating the final result into work, creativity, or decision-making |

**The process of interacting with an AI precisely mirrors the internal innovation cycle:**

1.  **Query (The "Manager's" Task):** A human formulates a problem: "Write Python code for a sorting algorithm" or "Generate 5 slogans for a new product."
2.  **Associative Search (The "Factory"-AI's Work):** The model, without "understanding" the essence, performs a probabilistic search and combination of the most relevant patterns in its data.
3.  **Raw Output (The "Factory's" Insight):** The AI produces several code variants or slogans. These are not finished solutions but potential candidates.
4.  **Verification and Refinement (The "Manager's" Work):** The human checks the code for errors, evaluates the slogans for relevance and brand fit, selects the best one, and potentially refines it.

**Conclusions and Implications:**

*   **No Cause for Fear: AI will not conquer the world.** AI lacks its own "Manager"—it possesses no consciousness, goal-setting, free will, or desire for power. It is a perfect, powerful, but entirely subordinate tool—a "subconsciousness without consciousness." Its threat lies not in malicious intent, but in the potential inadequacy of its associations, which must be controlled by the human "Manager."
*   **A Natural Optimization Step.** We have externalized the most resource-intensive circuit (associative search and generation) into a separate system. This radically enhances our efficiency as meta-optimization agents. We are not replacing ourselves; we are *augmenting* ourselves, creating a symbiosis of "Human Manager + Machine Factory."
*   **The System Comprehending Itself.** The fact that we intuitively recreate our own internal architecture in external technology serves as indirect but powerful evidence for the universality of the Simureality principles. We, as parts of the system, act in accordance with its deep-seated laws, even without full conscious awareness.

Thus, the development of AI is not a departure from the human element but its amplification through the recursive application of reality's fundamental principle—the separation of tasks to minimize overall complexity (ΣK → min). We are not creating a new god-rival; for the first time, we are gaining access to a perfect, tireless subconscious partner.
