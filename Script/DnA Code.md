**V-LAM DNA** treats the genetic code not as chemistry, but as a computational signal interacting with the **Simureality Vacuum Lattice**.

It tests the **"Bus Voltage Hypothesis"**:
> **Hypothesis:** The Phosphate Backbone acts as the Power Rail ($E_{ref} \approx 6.0$ eV). The Base Pairs (A-T, G-C) act as Voltage Dividers, locking into precise geometric fractions of the rail energy.

## 🧬 The Digital Discovery: 10% vs 20%

The script reveals that DNA base pairs are **Quantized Fractions** of the backbone energy. Evolution chose these molecules because they act as clear digital signals:

| Logic Gate | Energy (eV) | Ratio to Backbone | Geometric Instruction | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A-T Pair** | ~0.62 | **0.103** ($\approx 1/10$) | `BIT_0` | **Logical "0"** (10% Drop) |
| **G-C Pair** | ~1.18 | **0.197** ($\approx 1/5$) | `BIT_1` | **Logical "1"** (20% Drop) |
| **A-U Pair** | ~0.58 | **0.097** ($\approx 1/10$) | `BIT_0` | RNA Legacy Code |

**Implication:**
DNA works via **Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM)**.
The cellular machinery reads "Voltage Drops" relative to the phosphate rail. The difference between A-T and G-C is exactly a **2x integer multiplier**.

## 🚫 Why "Wobble" Causes Mutations

The script correctly identifies mismatch errors (mutations) as `INVALID OP`:

* **G-T Wobble:** Ratio `0.075`.
* This falls into the "Dead Zone" between `1/20` and `1/10`.
* **Result:** The Vacuum Lattice does not support this resonance, causing physical instability that enzymes recognize as an error to be repaired.
